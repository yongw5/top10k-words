Gentlemen's clubs are comfortable, private places with bars, a restaurant, a library and sometimes bedrooms. They attract as members businessmen, politicians and others from the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">upper class</span> and the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Establishment</span>. Members use their club as a place to meet friends or take business contacts. Most are situated in London's <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">West End</span> and many have large impressive buildings.</span><span class="p"><span class="ndv">Membership</span> is expensive and at most clubs is restricted to men, though the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Reform Club</span></span> has had women members since the 1960s. Generally, women and other <span class="ndv">non-members</span> are not allowed inside clubs except as guests of a member, and women are allowed only in certain rooms. Members must obey rules about dress and behaviour. People wanting to be members may have to wait a long time before they are admitted to the most popular clubs, and will only be allowed to join if an existing member <span class="eb">seconds</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> supports<span class="wrap">)</span></span> them. Any member may object to membership being offered to a particular person by <span class="eb">blackballing</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> voting against<span class="wrap">)</span></span> him.</span><span class="p">Gentlemen's clubs developed in the mid 18th century. Men had previously met socially and to discuss business in coffee houses where coffee, tea and chocolate, all new drinks in Britain at the time, were available. <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">White's</span>, the oldest London club, developed from a chocolate house. Some coffee houses, like the later clubs, were linked with particular professions. For instance, Lloyd's coffee house was associated with <span class="ndv">shipping</span> and later became <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Lloyd's of London</span></span>. In the 18th century clubs were mainly used for drinking and gambling but later attracted members who shared more serious interests. People interested in science and literature joined the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Athenaeum</span>, politicians went to the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Reform Club</span></span>, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Carlton Club</span></span> or Brooks's, and theatre people joined the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Garrick</span>.</span><span class="p">Today, the gentlemen's club suggests to many people an old-fashioned world based on class, where <span class="ndv">snobbery</span> and prejudice still survive. There is now less interest among younger business people in joining this type of club and several have had to close.</span><span class="p">In the US there are not many institutions like the gentlemen's club. Private universities like <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Harvard</span> have <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">alumni associations</span> for people who have studied there, and being a member of such clubs is associated with wealth and social status. The club building of the Harvard Club has in many ways the atmosphere of an English gentlemen's club.</span></span></span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Middle English</span></span> (in the sense <span class="qt">‘man of noble birth’</span>): from <span class="xr"><span class="xh">gentle</span></span> + <span class="xr"><span class="xh">man</span></span>, translating <span class="lang">Old French</span> <span class="ff">gentilz hom</span>.
