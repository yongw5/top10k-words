The houses are called <span class="ei">stately homes</span> from the opening lines of a poem by Felicia Hemans (1793–1835) . They are sometimes also called <span class="eb">country houses</span> because most of them are in the countryside. Some are approached through large iron gates down a long <span class="ndv">drive</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> private road<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Many have formal gardens and are surrounded by a large private <span class="eb">park</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> an area of grass and trees<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, often with a lake.</span><span class="p">Stately homes range from small <span class="eb">manor houses</span> to <span class="eb">palaces</span>. Manor houses date from the 14th century and are often square stone buildings with a central <span class="eb">courtyard</span>, and some are entered by crossing a <span class="ndv">moat</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a deep channel, sometimes containing water<span class="wrap">)</span></span> which was originally a means of defence. Some larger houses were built in the 16th century, including <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Hampton Court</span></span> in south-west London, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Burghley House</span></span> near Peterborough and Hardwick Hall near Derby.</span><span class="p">Many stately homes date from the 18th century, and are associated with famous <span class="ndv">architects</span>. <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Blenheim</span> Palace near Oxford was designed in the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">baroque</span> style by <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Vanbrugh</span> and <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Hawksmoor</span>. Holkham Hall in Norfolk, designed only a few years later by William <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Kent</span>, is in the <span class="ndv">Palladian</span> style. Kedleston Hall near Derby, the home of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Curzon</span> family, was mainly the work of <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Robert Adam</span></span>. The large <span class="ndv">estates</span> attached to stately homes attracted <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">landscape gardeners</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> people who design gardens<span class="wrap">)</span></span> such as ‘Capability’ <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Brown</span>, who laid out the gardens at Burghley, Blenheim and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Chatsworth</span>.</span><span class="p">Stately homes are very expensive to look after and, in order to get enough money to do this, some owners open their houses to the public. They charge visitors an <span class="eb">admission fee</span>. Many stately homes have been given by their owners to the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">National Trust</span>, an organization which raises the money to look after them from gifts, <span class="ndv">membership</span> fees and <span class="ndv">admission</span> charges. In many cases, the former owners continue to live in part of the house. This arrangement means that the house is well cared for, and the family does not have to pay <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">inheritance tax</span> when the owner dies.</span><span class="p">Visitors go to stately homes to admire their architecture, and to walk round the gardens. They also go to see valuable furniture, paintings, tapestries and china that have been collected over a long period . Sometimes, documents about the family or about historical events are also displayed. There is generally a cafe and a shop selling <span class="ndv">souvenirs</span>. During the summer, concerts or plays may be performed in the house or gardens. Some owners have added other attractions: at <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Longleat House</span></span>, for example, there is a <span class="ndv">safari park</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a park where people can drive round and see wild animals, e.g. lions<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="blockquote"> <div class="p-g"> <span class="wrap">“</span> <span class="p">The stately homes of England</span> <span class="p">How beautiful they stand!</span> <span class="p">Amidst their tall ancestral trees,</span> <span class="p">O'er all the pleasant land.</span> <span class="wrap">”</span> </div></span> <span class="blockquote"> <div class="p-g"> <span class="wrap">“</span> <span class="p">The stately homes of England</span> <span class="p">How beautiful they stand!</span> <span class="p">To prove the upper classes</span> <span class="p">Have still the upper hand.</span> <span class="wrap">”</span> </div><span class="footer">the first verse of Felicia Hemans' poem followed by Noel Coward's 1938 version</span></span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#5d0c0c179ca144c7b76fba642b2f8954" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2</span><span class="def">an area of land with a <span class="dh">manor house</span> on it</span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#5d0c0c179ca144c7b76fba642b2f8954" class="sen"></a><span class="num">3</span><span class="label-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="geo" geo="br">British English</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="reg">slang</span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">an area in which somebody works or for which they are responsible, especially officers at a police station</span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Middle English</span></span>: from <span class="lang">Anglo-Norman French</span> <span class="ff">maner</span> ‘dwelling’, from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">manere</span> ‘remain’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the ancient manor of Tregarrick</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He bought the old manor and set about turning himself into the local squire.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The manor house is a grade II listed building.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
