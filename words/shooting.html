They are often also called <span class="eb">blood sports</span> because they involve killing animals. In Britain all three sports were traditionally associated with the upper classes, although today they all, especially fishing, attract a much wider group of people.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Fox-hunting</span>, usually called just 'hunting' in Britain, was until recently the most common form of hunting. A pack of specially trained dogs (called <span class="eb">foxhounds</span>) chase after and kill a fox while a group of people follow on horseback, traditionally wearing <span class="eb">pink</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> red jackets<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and blowing <span class="eb">horns</span>. Fox-hunting was once a popular subject for painting and some English country<span class="ndv" type="singlewd">pubs</span> display sets of <span class="ndv">prints</span>. Fox-hunting, together with <span class="eb">stag-hunting</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the hunting of male deer with dogs<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, <span class="eb">hare coursing</span>, in which <span class="ndv">greyhounds</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a type of dog<span class="wrap">)</span></span> chase after a <span class="eb">hare</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a type of rabbit<span class="wrap">)</span></span> are now illegal, as are other blood sports such as <span class="ndv">badger-baiting</span> and <span class="ndv">cockfighting</span>.</span><span class="p">The ban on hunting was an important political issue in Britain. Many people believe hunting is cruel and should be stopped, but some people living in the country see the ban as an attack on their way of life. The ban finally came into effect in 2005. Organizations opposed to hunting with dogs include the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">League Against Cruel Sports</span></span> and the RSPCA (<span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</span>). The main organization in favour is the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Countryside Alliance</span></span>.</span><span class="p">Shooting <span class="eb">game birds</span>, such as <span class="ndv">pheasant</span> and <span class="ndv">grouse</span>, is a sport mainly of the upper and middle classes. <span class="ndv">Grouse</span> shooting begins each year on 12 August, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Glorious Twelfth</span></span>, and takes place mainly in Scotland. The hunters often employ <span class="eb">beaters</span> to drive the birds towards their guns. Those who object to shooting at live birds for sport do <span class="eb">clay pigeon shooting</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> shooting at clay discs fired into the air<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">Fishing, often called <span class="eb">angling</span>, is a very popular sport and there are many angling clubs. Three main types of angling take place: <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">fly fishing</span>, <span class="eb">coarse fishing</span> and <span class="eb">sea fishing</span>. Fly-fishing, which is expensive, is fishing for salmon, trout and other fish in fast-flowing rivers, using specially disguised hooks. Coarse fishing in rivers and lakes for fish other than salmon and trout, most of which are thrown back after being caught, is more widely popular. On the coast people may fish with a <span class="eb">rod and line</span> from a boat or from the shore.</span><span class="p">The US probably has more hunting organizations than any other country. This is mainly because of two strong traditions: the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Constitution</span> gives all Americans the right to own guns, and Americans have always hunted animals for food. The first Europeans who settled America hunted deer, <span class="ndv">bear</span>, <span class="ndv">foxes</span>, <span class="ndv">turkeys</span> and ducks to survive, and many Americans still eat what they shoot. For these reasons, hunting is a sport for all classes and many people own <span class="eb">hunting rifles</span>. Americans do not use the name <span class="ei">field sports</span>. Instead they say <span class="eb">outdoor sports</span> or, because that can include camping, walking and boating, simply <span class="eb">hunting and fishing</span>. <span class="eb">Bird hunting</span> is often used instead of <span class="ei">shooting</span>, because that can also mean shooting at targets made of wood.</span><span class="p">Many other Americans are against hunting, but animal rights groups have little power against organizations like the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">National Rifle Association</span></span>, which has more than 4 million members, and other politically active groups that support hunting and fishing. <span class="ndv">Conservation</span> organizations like the Colorado Wildlife Coalition also use their influence to protect the rights of people to hunt and fish.</span><span class="p">The first US hunting club, the Gloucester Fox Hunting Club, was established in 1766 in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Philadelphia</span>. Fox-hunting now only takes place in a few eastern states where it is associated with the upper class and has little opposition. Americans generally hunt <span class="ndv">deer</span>, <span class="ndv">elk</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a type of deer<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, <span class="ndv">bear</span>, <span class="ndv">antelope</span>, <span class="ndv">mountain lion</span>, raccoon and wild birds. The <span class="eb">US Fish and Wildlife Service</span> is in charge of fishing and hunting laws. States have their own wildlife departments and sometimes both national and state permission is needed to hunt.</span><span class="p">Fishing is the most popular outdoor sport in America. Freshwater <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> river<span class="wrap">)</span></span> fish caught in the US include <span class="ndv">trout</span>, <span class="ndv">bass</span> and <span class="ndv">salmon</span>.
