<span class="eb">Her/​His Majesty's Government</span>, consists of a group of <span class="eb">ministers</span> led by the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">prime minister</span>. Ministers are attached to specialist <span class="eb">departments</span> which carry out government policy. <span class="eb">Ministers of the Crown</span>, the most senior ministers, are appointed by the queen or king on the recommendation of the prime minister. Other ministers are appointed directly by the prime minister. All ministers sit in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Parliament</span>, most of them in the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">House of Commons</span>.</span><span class="p">The senior minister in each department is generally called the <span class="eb">Secretary of State</span>, e.g. the Secretary of State for Health. The minister in charge of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</span> is called the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Foreign Secretary</span>. The <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Home Secretary</span> is in charge of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Home Office</span>. The finance minister is known as the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> and is head of the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Treasury</span>. Ministers in charge of departments are usually members of the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Cabinet</span>. The prime minister may also appoint a <span class="eb">Minister without Portfolio</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> without departmental responsibilities<span class="wrap">)</span></span> to take on special duties.</span><span class="p">A Secretary of State is usually supported by several <span class="eb">Ministers of State</span>, who each have a specific area of responsibility, and <span class="eb">Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State</span>, often called <span class="eb">junior ministers</span>.</span><span class="p">Departments are run by <span class="eb">civil servants</span> who are not allowed to show favour to any political party. Unlike ministers, they do not have to leave their jobs when the government changes. Many departments are assisted by special groups that give advice and do research. A change of government does not necessarily affect the number and general organization of departments. A new government may, however, create new departments or change the structure of existing ones.</span><span class="p">Some departments, e.g. the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Ministry of Defence</span></span>, have responsibility for the whole of the United Kingdom. Others cover only part and the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Scottish Parliament</span> and the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Welsh Assembly</span> have responsibility for the corresponding areas in Scotland and Wales. (<span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">note at</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://devolution" otitle="devolution definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">devolution</span></span></a></span>)</span><span class="p">The leader of the main opposition party appoints a <span class="eb">shadow cabinet</span> of <span class="eb">shadow ministers</span>. Each is responsible for speaking about an area of government.</span><span class="p">In the US the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">federal government</span></span> has 15 departments. These, together with the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">president</span> and various government <span class="eb">agencies</span>, make up the <span class="eb">executive branch</span> of the government and are responsible for its day-to-day operation.</span><span class="p">The people in charge of government departments are called <span class="eb">secretaries</span>. For example, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Department of Agriculture</span></span> is led by the Secretary of Agriculture. The head of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">State Department</span>, the department that deals with US foreign policy, is called the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Secretary of State</span>. The President decides who will be the head of each department. Not all secretaries are well known: many people know the name of the Secretary of State, but few know the Secretary of Agriculture.</span><span class="p">Most of the people working in US government departments are civil servants whose jobs do not depend on political influence. In this way each department has a base of employees with a lot of knowledge and experience, whose careers last longer than a single political administration. Departments may be reorganized according to what issues seem important at a particular time but this kind of change does not happen very often.</span><span class="p">The heads of departments form a group called the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Cabinet</span>, which meets regularly with the President. The President is not required to accept their advice, but may choose to do so.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Wordfinder"><span class="unbox"> <span class="heading"
