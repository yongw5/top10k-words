About</span><span class="body"><span class="h1">meals</span><span class="bullet"><span class="li"> People use the words <span class="eb">dinner</span>, <span class="eb">lunch</span>, <span class="eb">supper</span> and <span class="eb">tea</span> in different ways depending on which English-speaking country they come from. In Britain it may also depend on which part of the country or which social class a person comes from.</span><span class="li"> A meal eaten in the middle of the day is usually called <span class="eb">lunch</span>. If it is the main meal of the day it may also be called <span class="eb">dinner</span> in <span class="label-g"><span class="geo" geo="br">British English</span></span>, especially in the north of the country.</span><span class="li"> A main meal eaten in the evening is usually called <span class="eb">dinner</span>, especially if it is a formal meal. <span class="eb">Supper</span> is also an evening meal, but more informal than <span class="eb">dinner</span> and usually eaten at home. It can also be a late meal or something to eat and drink before going to bed.</span><span class="li"> In <span class="label-g"><span class="geo" geo="br">British English</span></span>, <span class="eb">tea</span> is a light meal in the afternoon with sandwiches, cakes, etc. and a cup of tea:<span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"><span class="x">a cream tea.</span></span></span> It can also be a main meal eaten early in the evening, especially by children:<span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"><span class="rx-g"><span class="x">What time do the kids have their tea?</span></span></span></span></span><span class="li"> As a general rule, if <span class="eb">dinner</span> is the word someone uses for the meal in the middle of the day, they probably call the meal in the evening <span class="eb">tea</span> or <span class="eb">supper</span>. If they call the meal in the middle of the day <span class="eb">lunch</span>, they probably call the meal in the evening <span class="eb">dinner</span>.</span><span class="li"> <span class="eb">Brunch</span>, a combination of breakfast and lunch, is becoming more common, especially as a meal where your guests serve themselves.</span></span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Culture"><span class="unbox"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Culture</span><span class="body"><span class="h1">meals</span><span class="p">Americans and British people generally eat three meals a day though the names vary according to people's <span class="ndv">lifestyles</span> and where they live.</span><span class="p">The first meal of the day is <span class="eb">breakfast</span>. The traditional <span class="eb">full English breakfast</span> served in many British hotels may include fruit juice, <span class="ndv">cereal</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a food made from processed grains and eaten with milk<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, bacon and eggs, often with sausages and tomatoes, <span class="ndv">toast</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> slices of bread cooked until they turn brown<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="ndv">marmalade</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> jam made with oranges and similar fruit<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, and tea or coffee. Few people have time to prepare a cooked breakfast at home and most have only cereal and/​or toast with tea or coffee. Others buy coffee and a <span class="ndv">pastry</span> on their way to work.</span><span class="p">The traditional <span class="eb">American breakfast</span> includes eggs, some kind of meat and toast. Eggs may be fried, ‘over easy’, ‘over hard’ or ‘sunny side up’, or boiled, <span class="ndv">poached</span> or in an <span class="ndv">omelette</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> beaten together and fried<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. The meat may be bacon or sausage. People who do not have time for a large meal have toast or cereal and coffee. It is common for Americans to eat breakfast in a restaurant. On Saturday and Sunday many people eat <span class="eb">brunch</span> late in the morning. This consists of both breakfast and lunch dishes, including <span class="ndv">pancakes</span> and <span class="ndv">waffles</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> types of cooked batter<span class="wrap">)</span></span> that are eaten with butter and <span class="ndv">maple syrup</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a sweet, sticky sauce produced from a type of <span class="ndv">maple</span> tree<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Lunch</span>, which is eaten any time after midday, is the main meal of the day for some British people, though people out at work may have only <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">sandwich</span>es. Some people also refer to the midday meal as <span class="eb">dinner</span>. Most workers are allowed about an hour off work for it, called the <span class="eb">lunch hour</span>, and many also go shopping. Many schools offer a cooked lunch (<span class="eb">school lunch</span> or <span class="eb">school dinner</span>), though some students take a <span class="eb">packed lunch</span> of sandwiches, fruit, etc. <span class="eb">Sunday lunch</span> is special and is, for many families, the biggest meal of the week, consisting traditionally of roast meat and vegetables and a sweet course. In the US lunch is usually a quick meal, eaten around midday. Many workers have a half-hour break for lunch, and buy a sandwich from near their place of work. Business people may sometimes eat a larger lunch and use the time to discuss business.</span><span class="p">The main meal of the day for most people is the evening meal, called <span class="eb">supper</span>, <span class="eb">tea</span> or <span class="eb">dinner</span>. It is usually a cooked meal with meat or fish or a salad, followed by a sweet course. In Britain younger children may have tea when they get home from school. <span class="ei">Tea</span>, meaning a main meal for adults, is the word used in some parts of Britain especially when the evening meal is eaten early. <span class="ei">Dinner</span> sounds more formal than <span class="ei">supper</span>, and guests generally receive invitations to ‘dinner’ rather than to ‘supper’. In the US the evening meal is called <span class="ei">dinner</span> and is usually eaten around 6 or 6.30 p.m. In many families, both in Britain and in the US, family members eat at different times and rarely sit down at the table together.</span><span class="p">Many people also eat <span class="eb">snacks</span> between meals. Most have tea or coffee at mid-morning, often called <span class="eb">coffee time</span> or the <span class="eb">coffee break</span>. In Britain in the past this was sometimes also called <span class="eb">elevenses</span>. In the afternoon many British people have a <span class="eb">tea break</span>. Some hotels serve <span class="eb">afternoon tea</span> which consists of tea or coffee and a choice of sandwiches and cakes. When on holiday/​vacation people sometimes have a <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">cream tea</span> of scones, jam and cream. In addition many people eat chocolate bars, biscuits (<span class="ei">AmE</span> cookies) or crisps (<span class="ebi">AmE</span> chips). Some British people have a snack, sometimes called supper, consisting of a milk drink and a biscuit before they go to bed. In the US children often have milk and cookies after school.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a href="entry://#3926bac70f67471ca9695cb69ebd93f1" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2 </span><span class="sym_first"> <a class="oxford3000 no-href">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">countable</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">a large formal social gathering at which dinner is eaten</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">The club's annual dinner will be held on 3 June.</span></span></span></span></li> <span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">see also</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://dinner party" otitle="dinner party definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">dinner party</span></span></a></span></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Middle English</span></span>: from <span class="lang">Old French</span> <span class="ff">disner</span> (infinitive used as a noun), probably from <span class="ff">desjëuner</span> ‘to break fast’, from <span class="ff">des-</span> (expressing reversal) + <span class="ff">jëun</span> ‘fasting’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">A gala dinner was held to celebrate the world premiere of the movie.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">A state dinner was held in honour of the visiting Japanese premier.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Are we expected to dress for dinner?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I always forgot to take my dinner money to school.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">My old school is giving a fund-raising dinner</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The club’s annual dinner is this week.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The extensive dinner menu includes Russian delicacies.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The former Olympic champion was invited to speak at a charity dinner.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The school dinner menu always includes a balance of food types.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">There was never much conversation at the dinner table in my family.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">They invited three couples to a dinner party at their house.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We attended the formal reunion dinner.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We didn’t wash up the dinner things until the morning after.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We’re going to attend a formal dinner in aid of cancer research.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a bone-china dinner service</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the society’s annual dinner dance</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Have you had dinner yet?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I used to hate school dinners.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I’d like to take you out to dinner tonight.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">It’s time for dinner.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">It’s your turn to get dinner.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Let’s invite them to dinner.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She didn’t eat much dinner.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The club’s annual dinner will be held on the 4th of June.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The evening includes a three-course dinner with wine.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> <span class="idm-gs"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Idioms</span> <span class="idm-g"> <div class="top-container"> <div class="top-g"> <span class="idm">a dog’s breakfast/dinner</span> <div class="clear"> &nbsp;
