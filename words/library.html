Many older libraries were built with money given by <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Andrew Carnegie</span></span>, a US businessman originally from Scotland.</span><span class="p">Public libraries are often open until late evening during the week, part of Saturday, and in the US even on Sunday. <span class="eb">Librarians</span> manage the libraries and advise people how to find the books or information they need.</span><span class="p">Public libraries contain <span class="eb">fiction</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> story books<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, <span class="eb">non-fiction</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> books containing facts<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, children's books, and usually magazines, <span class="ndv">CDs</span> and DVDs, and have computers with access to the Internet. Every library has a <span class="eb">catalogue</span> which shows where books on a particular subject can be found. Many US university libraries use the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Library of Congress</span> system for arranging books in order on the shelves. In Britain and in public libraries in the US the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Dewey decimal classification</span> system is the most used.</span><span class="p">Libraries are often divided into a <span class="eb">reference section</span> and a <span class="eb">lending section</span>. Books from the reference section, e.g. dictionaries and <span class="ndv">directories</span>, as well as newspapers and magazines, can only be used in the library. Books from the lending section can be borrowed free of charge for a period of two or three weeks by people who are members of the library. Anyone living in the local area can join a library and obtain a <span class="eb">library card</span>. If a book is returned late, after the <span class="eb">due date</span>, the borrower has to pay a <span class="eb">fine</span>. Books can be ordered over the Internet, and electronic books can also be <span class="ndv">downloaded</span>. Public libraries are also a source of local information and a centre for community activities. Many have special programmes for children to help them feel comfortable using a library. In school holidays they organize storytelling and other entertainments.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Travelling libraries</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> libraries set up inside large vans<span class="wrap">)</span></span> take books round country areas for people who cannot easily get to a town. In the US travelling libraries are called <span class="eb">bookmobiles</span>. Schools, colleges and universities have their own private libraries for the use of students and teachers.</span><span class="p">In both Britain and the US public libraries receive money from local and national government but, increasingly, they do not receive enough for their needs. In Britain some smaller libraries have had to close and many more are threatened with being closed. In the US people believe strongly that information and education should be freely available. Libraries are important in achieving this but, as in Britain, they do not get sufficient money and depend on the help of <span class="ndv">volunteers</span> who work without pay.</span><span class="p">The biggest library in Britain is the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">British Library</span></span> in London with over 150 million books, CDs, DVDs and tape recordings. Other important libraries include the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Cambridge University</span></span> Library and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Bodleian Library</span></span> in Oxford . These libraries are called <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">copyright libraries</span> or <span class="eb">legal deposit libraries</span> and are entitled to receive a free copy of every book that is published in Britain. The largest library in the US is the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Library of Congress</span> in Washington, DC.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#560f54bf6728444da569c0f913ef5043" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2</span> <span class="def">a room in a large house where most of the books are kept</span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#560f54bf6728444da569c0f913ef5043" class="sen"></a><span class="num">3</span><span class="label-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="reg">formal</span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">a personal collection of books, CDs, etc.</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a new edition to add to your library</span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#560f54bf6728444da569c0f913ef5043" class="sen"></a><span class="num">4</span><span class="def">a series of books, recordings, etc. produced by the same company and similar in appearance</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a library of children’s classics</span></span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">late Middle English</span></span>: via <span class="lang">Old French</span> from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">libraria</span> ‘bookshop’, feminine (used as a noun) of <span class="ff">librarius</span> ‘relating to books’, from <span class="ff">liber</span>, <span class="ff">libr-</span> ‘book’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">A number of councils operate mobile libraries.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Do you have any books to take back to the library?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Do you know about the other services available at your local library?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Everyone in the country should have access to a lending library.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">How often do you go to the library?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I got this very interesting book out of the library.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I’ve been reading newspapers in the library.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">In 1784 he established his first circulating library.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">It is a copyright library and receives three copies of all books published in Britain.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She had built up an impressive library of art books.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Students are taught library skills in the first week of their course.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The family possessed an extensive library.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The library has an extensive collection of books on Chinese history.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The school has an excellent library.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a holiday programme for children at the local library</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a personal library of over 1 000 volumes</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a plan to provide mobile library services in rural environments</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">teaching library skills to schoolchildren</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the Herbert Hoover presidential library in West Branch, Iowa</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the need to improve library provision</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
