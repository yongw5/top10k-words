It was also the first sport organized in the American <span class="ndv">colonies</span>. This was in 1664 on <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Long Island</span></span>, New York. Four years later the first American sports trophy, a silver bowl, was presented there.</span><span class="p">There are two main types of horse racing. In <span class="eb">flat racing</span> horses run against each other over a set distance. In <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">National Hunt</span></span> racing, also called <span class="eb">steeplechasing</span>, horses jump over fences and <span class="ndv">ditches</span> round a course. The main <span class="eb">flat races</span> in Britain each year are the English Classics, five races for three-year-old horses. These are the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Derby</span> and the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Oaks</span> (both run at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Epsom</span>), the Thousand Guineas and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Two Thousand Guineas</span></span> (run at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Newmarket</span>) and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">St Leger</span></span> (run at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Doncaster</span>). The four-day <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Royal Ascot</span></span> meeting is an important social occasion, attended by members of the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">royal family</span></span>. The most famous <span class="eb">steeplechase</span> is the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Grand National</span></span>, which was first run in 1836 and which takes place each spring at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Aintree</span>. Many people who take no interest in horse racing have a bet on this race. Racing attracts people from all levels of British society but only the rich can afford to own and train a <span class="eb">racehorse</span>.</span><span class="p">In the US flat racing is called <span class="eb">thoroughbred racing</span> or just racing; <span class="eb">steeplechasing</span> is not often seen. The most famous race is the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Kentucky Derby</span></span>, which began in 1875 and is run each year at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Louisville</span>, Kentucky. This is a big event on national television, and informal bets are made in offices and homes, even in states where gambling is illegal. Other important races are the <span class="eb">Preakness</span> at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Baltimore</span>, Maryland, and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Belmont Stakes</span></span> at Elmont, New York. The three together are called the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">triple crown</span></span>.</span><span class="p">Famous British and US jockeys have included Willie Carson, Pat Eddery, Lester Piggott, Peter Scudamore, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Willie Shoemaker</span></span>, Laffit Pincay, Angel Cordero, Steve Cauthen, Kieren Fallon, Frankie Dettori and A.P. McCoy. Horses famous in Britain have included Arkle, Desert Orchid, Nijinsky, Red Rum, Best Mate and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Shergar</span>, and in the US Galant Fox, Secretariat, Affirmed, Man o' War, Native Dancer and Cigar, which was chosen <span class="eb">Horse of the Year</span> in 1995 and 1996.</span><span class="p">A type of race popular in America is <span class="eb">harness racing</span>, in which a horse pulls a small two-wheeled cart called a <span class="eb">sulky</span> with its driver. The most famous race is the Hambletonian, popularly called the ‘Hambo’, at the Meadowlands Racetrack in <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">New Jersey</span></span>. Harness racing's triple crown is the Hambletonian, the Kentucky Futurity, and the Yonkers Trot.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Betting</span> on the result of a race is for many British people an important part of the sport and contributes to the atmosphere of excitement and tension at a <span class="eb">racecourse</span>. Before a race starts <span class="eb">bookmakers</span> take bets, calculate <span class="eb">the odds</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the likelihood of each horse winning<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and say which horse is the <span class="eb">favourite</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the horse considered most likely to win<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. People can also bet on a race on the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Internet</span> or at a <span class="eb">bookmaker's</span> or <span class="eb">betting shop</span>. Betting shops show live television broadcasts of races.</span><span class="p">Americans also like to <span class="eb">play the ponies</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> have a bet<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. People can bet beside the track or <span class="eb">off-track</span>. Telephone bets can be made in some states. Even though many Americans do not approve of betting, most have accepted horse racing as an exciting sport and a US tradition. This is reflected in popular culture. <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Camptown Races</span></span> is one of <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Stephen Foster's</span></span> most popular songs. <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Damon Runyon</span></span> set many of his short stories at race tracks, the mystery novels of Dick Francis are set in the world of racing and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Hollywood</span> has produced popular films about racing such as <span class="ebi">National Velvet</span> (1945) and <span class="ebi">The Black Stallion</span> (1980) .</span><span class="xr-gs"> <span class="prefix">see also</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://greyhound racing" otitle="greyhound racing definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">greyhound racing</span></span></a></span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a href="entry://#7ca8cdcb8cb34a48bba5dab735df224c" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2 </span><span class="sym_first"> <a class="oxford3000 no-href">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="use"><span class="wrap">(</span>usually in compounds<span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">any sport that involves competing in races</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x"><span class="cl"><strong>motor/yacht/greyhound, etc. racing</strong></span></span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a racing driver</span></span></span> <span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">see also</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://drag racing" otitle="drag racing definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">drag racing</span></span></a></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He has ridden horses all his life, but he was a late starter in the racing game.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He made his racing debut for Benetton three years ago.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He organizes his life according to the racing calendar.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He’s known in racing circles as a fierce competitor.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Her racing tipster got the Derby winner right.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Racing fans adore statistics on horses, jockeys, and performance.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She’s a familiar face on the racing scene.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The bikes sped by on the racing circuit.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Today’s cross-country event marks his return to top-level racing.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Today’s event marks his return to competitive racing.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">racing legend Ayrton Senna</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the racing correspondent of ‘The Times’</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
