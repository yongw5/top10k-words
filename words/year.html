The year is divided into 12 months, with 30 or 31 days in each month, except February, which has 28 days. An extra day is added to February every fourth year, called a <span class="eb">leap year</span>, to keep the calendar in time with the moon. A well-known verse helps people remember how many days there are in each month:</span> <span class="blockquote"> <div class="p-g"> <span class="wrap">“</span> <span class="p">Thirty days hath September,</span> <span class="p">April, June and November.</span> <span class="p">All the rest have thirty-one,</span> <span class="p">Excepting February alone,</span> <span class="p">Which hath twenty-eight days clear,</span> <span class="p">and twenty-nine in each leap year.</span> <span class="wrap">”</span> </div></span><span class="p">The <span class="eb">calendar year</span> starts on 1 January, <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">New Year's Day</span>. The number of each year (2003, 2004, etc.) represents the number of years that have passed since the birth of Jesus Christ. The year 2000 marked the end of the second <span class="ndv">millennium</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a period of 1 000 years<span class="wrap">)</span></span> since Christ was born. The years before Christ are described as <span class="eb">BC</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> before Christ<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, e.g. 55 BC, or <span class="eb">BCE</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> before the Common Era<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. The abbreviations <span class="eb">AD</span> (Latin <span class="ei">Anno Domini</span>, meaning ‘in the year of the Lord’) or <span class="eb">CE</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> Common Era<span class="wrap">)</span></span> are put before or after the date for the years after Christ's birth, e.g. AD 44 or 44 AD, but they are not used with years after about 200 AD. Some cultural and religious groups use different calendars: the year 2000 in the Gregorian calendar began during the year 5760 in the Jewish calendar, 1420 in the Islamic calendar and 1921 in the Hindu calendar.</span><span class="p">The <span class="eb">academic year</span> used by schools and colleges in Britain runs from September to July, with short holidays at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Christmas</span> and in the spring and a long summer vacation. In the US the academic year runs from August or September to May or June. Many business companies have a <span class="eb">financial year</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a period of accounting<span class="wrap">)</span></span> that runs from April to the following March. The <span class="eb">tax year</span> in the US is the same as the calendar year but the tax year in Britain begins on 5 April. The reason is that in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">medieval</span> times the calendar year began on 25 March, not 1 January. When the Gregorian Calendar was introduced, an <span class="ndv">adjustment</span> was needed and 11 days were removed from September 1752. To avoid being accused of collecting a full year's taxes in a short year, the government <span class="ndv">extended</span> the end of the tax year 1752–3 to 4 April.</span><span class="p">Many festivals are celebrated during the year. Christmas and Easter are the main Christian festivals. Jews remember Passover and Yom Kippur. Ramadan, a month of fasting <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> not eating during the day<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, and Eid ul-Fitr are celebrated by Muslims. Diwali, the Hindu festival of light, takes place in October or November, and the Chinese celebrate their new year in January or February. Special occasions such as <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Bonfire Night</span> in Britain and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Thanksgiving</span> in the US are enjoyed by almost everyone</span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a href="entry://#7c5f5d8ffc004bd48a9172bb7d36d91d" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2 </span><span class="sym_first"> <a
