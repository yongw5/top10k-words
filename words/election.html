least every five years, when the <span class="eb">electorate</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> all the people in the country who can vote<span class="wrap">)</span></span> vote for the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Members of Parliament</span> or <span class="eb">MPs</span> in the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">House of Commons</span>. Each MP represents a <span class="eb">constituency</span>, which is an area of the country with a roughly equal number of people (about 90 000 people) and is expected to be interested in the affairs of the constituency and to represent the interests of local people. If an MP dies or <span class="ndv">resigns</span>, a <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">by-election</span> is held in the constituency he or she represented. Before an election one person is chosen by each of the main political parties to be their <span class="eb">candidate</span>. <span class="eb">Independent candidates</span>, who do not belong to a political party, can also <span class="eb">stand for election</span>. Each candidate has to leave a <span class="eb">deposit</span> with the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">returning officer</span>, the person responsible for managing the election, which is returned to them if they win more than 5% of the votes, otherwise they <span class="eb">lose their deposit</span>. Before an election, candidates <span class="ndv">campaign</span> for support in their constituency and local <span class="eb">party workers</span> spend their time <span class="eb">canvassing</span>, going from house to house to ask people about how they intend to vote. At the national level the parties spend a lot of money on advertising and <span class="ndv">media coverage</span>. They cannot buy television time, but each party is allowed a number of strictly timed <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">party political broadcasts</span></span>.</span><span class="p">Anyone over the age of 18 has the right to vote at elections, provided they are on the <span class="eb">electoral register</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> list of adults in a constituency<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Voting is not <span class="ndv">compulsory</span>. The <span class="eb">turnout</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> number of people who vote<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in recent general elections has been about 60%, although in the past 75% was more usual. On the day of the election, called <span class="eb">polling day</span>, voters go to a <span class="eb">polling station</span>, often in a local school or church hall, and are given a <span class="eb">ballot paper</span>. The ballot paper lists all the candidates for that constituency and the parties they represent. The voter goes into a <span class="eb">polling booth</span>, where nobody can see what he or she is writing, and puts a cross next to the name of one candidate only. After <span class="eb">the polls</span> close, the ballot papers are taken to a central place to be counted. <span class="eb">Counting</span> usually takes place on the same day as the election, continuing late into the night if necessary. If the number of votes for two candidates is very close, they can demand a <span class="eb">recount</span>. Only the candidate who gets the most votes in each constituency is elected. This system is called <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">first-past-the-post</span>. The winning party, which forms the next <span class="eb">government</span>, is the one that wins most <span class="eb">seats</span> in Parliament <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> has the most MPs<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">In the US, elections are held regularly for President, for both houses of <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Congress</span> and for state and local government offices. Candidates usually <span class="eb">run for office</span> with the support of one of the two main political parties, the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Republican Party</span> or the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Democratic Party</span>, although anyone wanting to run as an <span class="eb">independent</span> can organize a <span class="eb">petition</span> and ask people to sign it. Some people also run as <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">write-in candidates</span></span>: they ask voters to add their name to the ballot when they vote. A large amount of money is spent on election <span class="ndv">campaigning</span>, where candidates try to achieve <span class="eb">name recognition</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> making their names widely known<span class="wrap">)</span></span> by advertising on television, in newspapers and on <span class="ndv">posters</span>. They take part in <span class="eb">debates</span> and hold <span class="eb">rallies</span> where they give speeches and go round<span class="eb">'pressing the flesh'</span>, shaking hands with as many voters as possible.</span><span class="p">Only a person over 35 who was born in the US can <span class="eb">run for President</span>. Presidential elections are held every four years and early in election year, the political parties choose their candidates through a series of <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">primary</span> elections held in each state. As these <span class="eb">races</span> take place it gradually becomes clear which candidates are the strongest and in the summer each party holds a <span class="eb">convention</span> to make the final choice of candidates for President and Vice-President. In November, the people go to vote and although the President is said to be directly elected, the official vote is made by an <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">electoral college</span>. Each state has a certain number of <span class="eb">electors</span> in the college based on the state's population. All the electors from a state must vote for the candidate who got the most votes in the state, and the candidate with at least 270 votes out of 538 becomes President. After the election, the new President goes to Washington for the <span class="eb">inauguration</span> on 20 January, and takes the <span class="eb">oath of office</span>.</span><span class="p">Americans over the age of 18 have the right to vote, but only about half of them take part in presidential elections and <span class="eb">voter turnout</span> for other elections is even lower. On election day, voters go to polling stations where they first have to sign their name in a book that lists all the voters in the <span class="eb">precinct</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> area<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and then <span class="eb">cast a vote</span>. Some states use <span class="ndv">computerized</span> voting systems and in others voters pull down a metal <span class="ndv">lever</span> beside the name of the person they want to vote for which operates a mechanical counter. It is possible to select all the candidates from one party, which is called <span class="eb">voting a straight ticket</span>, but many voters choose candidates from both parties and <span class="eb">vote a split ticket</span>. Journalists and <span class="eb">pollsters</span> are allowed to ask people how they voted and these <span class="eb">exit polls</span> help to predict election results. However, the results of exit polls may not be announced until polling stations everywhere have closed, in case they influence the result.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"
