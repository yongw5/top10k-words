is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Culture</span><span class="body"><span class="h1">sport and fitness</span><span class="p">The British like sport very much, but many people prefer to watch rather than take part. Many go to watch football, rugby, cricket, etc. at the ground, but many more sit at home and watch sport on television.</span><span class="p">Most people today take relatively little general <span class="eb">exercise</span>. Over the last 30 or 40 years <span class="ndv">lifestyles</span> have changed considerably and many people now travel even the shortest distances by car or bus. Lack of exercise combined with eating too many <span class="ndv">fatty</span> and sugary foods has meant that many people are becoming too fat. Experts are particularly concerned that children spend a lot of their free time watching television or playing computer games instead of being physically active. In recent years, however, there has been a growing interest in <span class="ndv">fitness</span> among young adults and many belong to a <span class="eb">sports club</span> or <span class="eb">gym</span>.</span><span class="p">In Britain most towns have an amateur football and cricket team, and people also have opportunities to play sports such as tennis and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">golf</span>. Older people may play <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">bowls</span>. Some people go regularly to a <span class="eb">sports centre</span> or <span class="eb">leisure centre</span> where there are facilities for playing <span class="ndv">badminton</span> and <span class="ndv">squash</span>, and also a swimming pool. Some sports centres arrange classes in activities such as <span class="eb">aerobics</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> energetic exercises to music to increase the amount of oxygen in the blood<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, <span class="eb">step</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> stepping on and off a low step rhythmically to music<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="eb">keep-fit</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> more gentle stretching exercises<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Some people <span class="eb">work out</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> train hard<span class="wrap">)</span></span> regularly at a local gym and do <span class="eb">weight training</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> lifting weights to strengthen their muscles<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="eb">circuit training</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a series of energetic exercises<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. A few people do judo or other <span class="eb">martial arts</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> fighting sports<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Others <span class="eb">go running</span> or <span class="eb">jogging</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> running at a leisurely pace<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in their local area. For enthusiastic runners there are opportunities to take part in long-distance runs, such as the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">London marathon</span></span>. Other people keep themselves fit by walking or cycling. Many people go abroad on a <span class="ndv">skiing</span> holiday each year and there are several dry slopes and snowdomes in Britain where they can practise.</span><span class="p">Membership of a sports club or gym can be expensive and not everyone can afford the <span class="ndv">subscription</span>. Local sports centres are generally cheaper. <span class="eb">Evening classes</span> are also cheap and offer a wide variety of fitness activities ranging from yoga to jazz dancing. Some companies now provide sports facilities for their employees or contribute to the cost of joining a gym.</span><span class="p">Sports play an important part in American life. Professional <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">baseball</span> and football games attract large crowds, and many people watch games on television. Although many parents complain about their children being <span class="eb">couch potatoes</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> people who spend a lot of time watching television<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, there are sports sessions at school for all ages. College students are usually also required to take physical education classes to complete their studies.</span><span class="p">Many popular keep-fit activities began in the US. <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Charles Atlas</span></span>, Arnold Schwarzenegger and others inspired people to take up <span class="eb">bodybuilding</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> strengthening and shaping the muscles<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Many women joined the ‘fitness craze’ as a result of <span class="eb">video workouts</span> produced by stars such as Jane Fonda and Cindy Crawford which they could watch and take part in at home. New <span class="ndv">fitness</span> books are continually being published and these create fashions for new types of exercise, such as <span class="eb">Zumba</span>, <span class="eb">wave aerobics</span>, which is done in a swimming pool, or <span class="eb">cardio kick-boxing</span>, a form of <span class="ndv">aerobics</span> which involves <span class="ndv">punching</span> and kicking a <span class="ndv">punchbag</span>. Many richer people employ their own <span class="eb">personal trainer</span>, either at home or at a <span class="eb">fitness centre</span>, to direct their exercise programme. Local <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">YMCAs</span> offer programmes which include aerobics, gym, running, weights, <span class="ndv">treadmills</span> and rowing machines, as well as steam rooms and swimming. But many people just walk or jog in the local park or play informal games of baseball or football.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#e6674a7759e14fe5845ce74f2968d8b4" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2</span><span class="def">the state of being suitable or good enough for something</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="cf"><span class="exp">fitness</span> for something</span> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">He convinced us of his fitness for the task.</span></span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="cf"><span class="exp">fitness</span> to do something</span> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">There were doubts about her fitness to hold office.</span></span></span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">A special trainer has been brought in to work on the tennis player’s fitness.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">First, determine your present fitness level.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He has attained peak fitness this season.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Hendry is back to match fitness and is expected to play.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Regular exercise helps to maintain physical fitness.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She’s a bit of a fitness freak.
