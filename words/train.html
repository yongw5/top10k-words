By the early 1900s, when railways reached the height of their popularity, there were about 23 000 miles/37 000 kilometres of railway <span class="eb">track</span>. <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Victorian</span> engineers such as <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</span></span> designed bridges for the railway, and <span class="ndv">architects</span> designed elaborate station buildings such as <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">St Pancras</span></span> in London.</span><span class="p">The railways played a vital role in Britain's industrial development during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Later, with the invention of the <span class="ndv">internal combustion engine</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the type of engine used in cars<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, road transport became more popular for both goods and passengers. In 1947 regional railway companies were <span class="ndv">nationalized</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> transferred to state ownership<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and became <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">British Rail</span></span> (later BR), but following the Beeching report in 1963 many <span class="eb">lines</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> routes<span class="wrap">)</span></span> were closed in order to save money. In 1994 the government decided that BR should be returned to private ownership. Tracks and stations were made the responsibility of a company called <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Railtrack</span>, while trains were once again operated by several companies on a regional basis.</span><span class="p">The railway network connects all the major towns in Britain, and now, via a high-speed service and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Channel Tunnel</span></span>, links Britain with France and Belgium. People are encouraged to use trains and other forms of public transport to help reduce fuel <span class="ndv">consumption</span> and <span class="ndv">pollution</span>. Railways are used for both short and long journeys, for <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">commuting</span> to work each day, and for transporting <span class="eb">freight</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> goods<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Some routes are now <span class="ndv">electrified</span> and have high-speed trains. Others still rely on <span class="ndv">diesel-powered</span> locomotives. Some trains are old, dirty and overcrowded. They also have a reputation for being late, and jokes are often made about the excuses given for delays. These have included ‘leaves on the line’ in autumn, and ‘the wrong kind of snow’. Tickets are quite expensive, although students and older people can get <span class="eb">railcards</span> which entitle them to cheaper fares. Cheaper fares are also available if tickets are booked in advance.</span><span class="p">Following several major railway accidents and the failure of the Railtrack company in 2002 the government set up <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Network Rail</span></span> to be responsible for the railway system used by the <span class="eb">train operating companies</span>, private companies which run the trains. These companies provide information about trains to the public through their organization, National Rail.</span><span class="p">Most Americans have never been on a train. This is sad because the <span class="eb">railroads</span>, as they are generally called in the US, were the means by which the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Old West</span></span> was settled. Passenger trains today mainly serve commuters around large cities. The only major long-distance railway business is done by <span class="eb">freight trains</span> (<span class="ei">BrE also</span> <span class="eb">goods trains</span>).</span><span class="p">The first US rail company was the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad in 1828, but its <span class="eb">cars</span> (<span class="ei">BrE</span> <span class="eb">carriages</span>) were pulled by horses. Steam power was used by the 1830s, and the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Pullman</span> car was invented in 1856. The <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Civil War</span> led to the rapid development of railroads, and the nation was connected from east to west in 1869 when the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Union Pacific Railroad</span></span> and Central Pacific joined their tracks in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Utah</span>. The 20th century brought more powerful locomotives and huge stations, like <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Grand Central Station</span> in New York. The greatest period of US railroads began in the middle of the 19th century and lasted about 100 years. This time has been celebrated with popular songs like <span class="ebi">I've Been Working on the Railroad</span>, <span class="ebi">Freight Train Blues</span>, <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">John Henry</span>, <span class="ebi">Chattanooga Choo Choo</span>, <span class="ebi">Orange Blossom Special</span> and <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Casey Jones</span>. Trains and railroad workers were also the subjects of many films and novels.</span><span class="p">After <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">World War II</span> car ownership greatly increased and people no longer used trains as a means of transport. Union Pacific, once known for its two-level ‘dome lounge cars’ from which passengers could see the scenery, stopped long-distance passenger services in 1971. <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Amtrak</span>, a company controlled by the government, now runs the California Zephyr, the Texas Eagle and other trains but it is not very successful in attracting passengers.</span><span class="p">Some Americans are <span class="eb">train buffs</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> people who love trains and know a lot about them<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and take special steam locomotive trips. Americans also collect model trains, some of which, including the heavy Lionel sets from the 1940s, are now valuable. In Britain old and young alike visit railway museums at e.g. Didcot and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">York</span>. <span class="eb">Trainspotting</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> recording the names and registration numbers of locomotives<span class="wrap">)</span></span> used to be a popular <span class="ndv">hobby</span>, especially for boys, but is less common now.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#5b64e03ad192443c820ea510625ca2a3" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2</span><span class="def">a number of people or animals moving in a line</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a camel train</span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#5b64e03ad192443c820ea510625ca2a3" class="sen"></a><span class="num">3</span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">usually singular</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">a series of events or actions that are connected</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">His death set in motion a <span class="cl"><strong>train of events</strong></span> that led to the outbreak of war.</span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#5b64e03ad192443c820ea510625ca2a3" class="sen"></a><span class="num">4</span><span class="def">the part of a long formal dress that spreads out on the floor behind the person wearing it</span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Middle English</span></span> (as a noun in the sense <span class="qt">‘delay’</span>): from <span class="lang">Old French</span> <span class="ff">train</span> (masculine), <span class="ff">traine</span> (feminine), from <span class="ff">trahiner</span> (verb), from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">trahere</span> ‘pull, draw’.
