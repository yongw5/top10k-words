Many people drink <span class="eb">bitter</span>, a brown-coloured beer. It is sold <span class="eb">on draught</span>, if it is drawn for each customer from a large container, usually a <span class="eb">keg</span> or <span class="eb">barrel</span>, or <span class="eb">bottled</span>, if it has been put in small bottles at a factory. Bitter is usually drunk at room temperature. <span class="eb">Lager</span>, which is yellow in colour, has more gas in it and is usually drunk cold. Many pubs sell a selection of lagers, from places such as France, Germany or Australia. <span class="eb">Stout</span> is a strong, dark brown beer which forms a thick white <span class="ndv">froth</span>, or <span class="eb">head</span>, on top when poured into a glass. <span class="eb">Mild</span> is a sweeter, darker form of bitter but is less popular. <span class="eb">Shandy</span> is a mixture of beer and lemonade or ginger beer. Draught beer or lager is sold in <span class="eb">pints</span> or <span class="eb">half-pints</span>. Some people drink <span class="eb">low-alcohol</span> beers and lagers in order to reduce the risk of <span class="eb">drink-driving</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> driving a car while under the influence of alcohol<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, which is against the law. Many people like to drink <span class="eb">real ale</span>, beer that is made and stored in the traditional way, often made by smaller <span class="eb">breweries</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> companies that make beer<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. The interests of real-ale drinkers are defended by <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">CAMRA</span>, the Campaign for Real Ale, which publishes a list of real-ale pubs and campaigns to prevent small breweries closing.</span><span class="p">The US <span class="eb">brewing</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> beer-making<span class="wrap">)</span></span> industry was begun by Germans who moved to the US, and so the typical US beer has always been like German beer, light in colour, similar to what the British call lager, although Americans do not use that word. Until the beginning of the 20th century there were many small, family-run breweries in the US, but then <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Prohibition</span> came into effect and it became illegal to sell alcohol. By the time Prohibition was cancelled most of the small breweries had gone out of business. Today, most beer is produced by a few large breweries, all of whom make similar products. Recently, however, Americans have begun to appreciate different sorts of beer and many <span class="eb">microbreweries</span> have opened. These brew and serve high-quality beer made in traditional ways. This movement has even led some of the large breweries to return to traditional methods and materials. The microbrewery movement has been supported mostly by professional people with a high income but, in general, beer is seen as a drink for people with less money, or for informal occasions. People drink beer after playing sports or while watching them, but wine is considered more appropriate to drink with a meal.</span><span class="p">Many makes of beer in the US are sold in both bottles and cans, though microbrewery beers come only in bottles. Restaurants always serve bottled beer. In some states beer can be sold in <span class="ndv">supermarkets</span>, <span class="ndv">gas stations</span> and local <span class="ndv">convenience stores</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> shops that are open for many hours each day<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. In other states it can be sold only in specially <span class="ndv">licensed</span> <span class="eb">liquor stores</span> or <span class="eb">bottle shops</span>.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a href="entry://#2e9699ea367a48d1830c7495947154dd" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2 </span><span class="sym_first"> <a class="oxford3000 no-href">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">countable</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">a glass, bottle or can of beer</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">Shall we have a beer?</span></span></span></span> <span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">see also</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://ginger beer" otitle="ginger beer definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">ginger beer</span></span></a><span class="sep">,</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://guest beer" otitle="guest beer definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">guest beer</span></span></a><span class="sep">,</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://keg beer" otitle="keg beer definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">keg beer</span></span></a><span class="sep">,</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://root beer" otitle="root beer definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">root beer</span></span></a><span class="sep">,</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://small beer" otitle="small beer definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">small beer</span></span></a></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Old English</span></span> <span class="etym_i">bēor</span>, of <span class="lang">West Germanic</span> origin, based on <span class="lang">monastic Latin</span> <span class="ff">biber</span> ‘a drink’, from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">bibere</span> ‘to drink’; related to <span class="lang">Dutch</span> <span class="ff">bier</span> and <span class="lang">German</span> <span class="ff">Bier</span>.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Children are welcome in the beer garden.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Do you drink beer?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He downed his beer in one go.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He poured us all a beer.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He slammed his glass down and the beer slopped over the sides.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He’s only twenty but he already has a beer belly.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I have some beers chilling in the cooler.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I ordered half a pint of beer with my sandwich.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I saw him at the bar ordering a beer.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I’m going (out) for a beer with Carl tonight.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Playing non-league football keeps him in beer money.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Put the beer in the fridge to chill.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Singing in bars keeps him in beer money= earns him a little money.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The bar smelled of stale beer.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The beer flowed freely after the game.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The pub has a beer garden round the back.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The shop specializes in designer beers.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">This beer should be drawn slowly.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Will you have a beer?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a glass of foaming ice-cold beer</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
