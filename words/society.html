club or society. <span class="ei">Club</span> is often used to refer to a group of people who regularly meet together socially or take part in sports. Most young people's groups are called <span class="ei">clubs</span>. A <span class="ei">society</span> is usually concerned with a special interest, e.g. birdwatching or local history, and sends newsletters or magazines to its members. National societies sometimes have local <span class="eb">branches</span>.</span><span class="p">Social clubs have a bar where members can sit and talk to each other. Members of the upper class or business people may belong to a <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">gentlemen's club</span>. Most of these are in London and even today only some of them allow women to be members. They are places to relax in, but also places to make business contacts in and to take clients to. <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Freemasonry</span> attracts business and professional men who may join a lodge <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> branch<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in their home town. Masons are sometimes accused of giving unfair advantages to other Masons in business, etc.</span><span class="p">Some clubs combine social events with community service. Members of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Rotary Club</span>, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Round Table</span></span>, the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Kiwanis</span> and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Lions Club</span></span> are usually professional or business people. In the US these organizations are called <span class="eb">service clubs</span>. Some are open only to men. They hold events to raise money for good causes, e.g. to provide scholarships for university students or to raise money for a hospital.</span><span class="p">In Britain, <span class="eb">working men's clubs</span> were set up for men doing manual jobs. The clubs offer a range of entertainment, such as comedians or <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">darts</span> matches, as well as a bar. In recent years some clubs have decided to admit women. In the US there are clubs based on ethnic origin, religion or military background. For example, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Knights of Columbus</span></span> is a club for <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Roman Catholic</span> men. People who have served in the armed forces join the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Veterans of Foreign Wars</span></span> or the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">American Legion</span></span>. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">British Legion</span></span> is a similar organization for former British servicemen.</span><span class="p">In Britain, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Women's Institute</span></span> and the Townswomen's Guild began with the aim of improving women's education. Both now organize social and cultural activities.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Nightclubs</span>, often called simply <span class="eb">clubs</span>, are places where mainly young people meet to drink and dance. They charge <span class="eb">admission fees</span> rather than a subscription. Fees are higher at weekends and in large cities, especially London.</span><span class="p">Many <span class="eb">sports clubs</span> hold parties and arrange social events, as well as providing facilities for various sports. <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Golf</span> clubs are sometimes expensive to join, and for some clubs there may be a long waiting list. Other sports clubs include those for squash, tennis, cricket, bowls, snooker and cycling. Many clubs own their own sports ground and <span class="eb">clubhouse</span> with a bar. Most towns also have gyms or fitness clubs. In Britain, <span class="eb">sports and social clubs</span> are run by some big companies for their employees and in the US most sports clubs are associated with companies. <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Softball</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">basketball</span> teams play against teams from other companies in the same city.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Country clubs</span> are found in green areas near cities all over the US. They offer sports like swimming, golf and tennis, and hold dances and other social events in the restaurants and bars. The oldest and most famous country club was established in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1882.</span><span class="p">Many Americans belong to the <span class="eb">alumni club</span> of the college or university they attended. Members take part in social activities and raise money for the university.</span><span class="p">Some students join <span class="eb">Greek societies</span>, societies named with Greek letters, e.g. Alpha Epsilon Pi. <span class="eb">Fraternities</span> are for men, and <span class="eb">sororities</span> are for women. Most Greek societies are social organizations and their members, who usually come from rich families, live in a fraternity or sorority house. After they leave university, many members continue to be active in the organization. There are also <span class="eb">honor societies</span> for outstanding students, which also have Greek letters in their names. <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Phi Beta Kappa</span> is the most famous of these. Some are for students in a particular subject, for example Psi Chi is for students in psychology. In Britain, schools, colleges and universities have societies for former students, often called <span class="eb">old boys'</span> or <span class="eb">old girls'</span><span class="eb">associations</span>.</span><span class="p">In most towns there are local societies for many interests, including singing, drama, film, folk music, archaeology , natural and local history and photography. Local branches of national societies, such as the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">National Trust</span> in Britain and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Audubon Society</span></span> in the US, organize events in their area. Only a small proportion of members attend local events, and most people join these societies because they support their aims.</span><span class="p">Clubs are an important feature of school life, especially in the US. They include clubs for science, drama and music, as well as language clubs. Outside school, children can join a local <span class="eb">youth club</span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Scouts</span> or <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Girl Guides</span>, or another youth organization.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#ba9f2690f7de4f12a280420e34ebff40" class="sen"></a><span class="num">4</span><span class="gram-g"><span
