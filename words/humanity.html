Some people may be very offended if you do not.</span></span><span class="h2">The human race</span><span class="bullet"><span class="li"> <span class="eb">Man</span> and <span class="eb">mankind</span> have traditionally been used to mean ‘all men and women’. Many people now prefer to use <span class="eb">humanity</span>, <span class="eb">the human race</span>, <span class="eb">human beings</span> or <span class="eb">people</span>.</span></span><span class="h2">Jobs</span><span class="bullet"><span class="li"> The suffix <span class="eb">-ess</span> in names of occupations such as <span class="eb">actress</span>, <span class="eb">hostess</span> and <span class="eb">waitress</span> shows that the person doing the job is a woman. Many people now avoid these. Instead you can use <span class="eb">actor</span> or <span class="eb">host</span> (although <span class="eb">actress</span> and <span class="eb">hostess</span> are still very common), or a neutral word, such as <span class="eb">server</span> for <span class="ei">waiter</span> and <span class="ei">waitress</span>.</span><span class="li"> Neutral words like <span class="eb">assistant</span>, <span class="eb">worker</span>, <span class="eb">person</span> or <span class="eb">officer</span> are now often used instead of <span class="ei">-man</span> or <span class="ei">-woman</span> in the names of jobs. For example, you can use <span class="eb">police officer</span> instead of <span class="ei">policeman</span> or <span class="ei">policewoman</span>, and <span class="eb">spokesperson</span> instead of <span class="ei">spokesman</span> or <span class="ei">spokeswoman</span>. Neutral words are very common in newspapers, on television and radio and in official writing, in both <span class="label-g"><span class="geo" geo="br">British English</span></span> and <span class="label-g"><span class="geo" geo="n_am">North American English</span></span>.</span><span class="li"> When talking about jobs that are traditionally done by the other sex, some people say: <span class="eb">a male secretary</span>/<span class="eb">nurse</span>/<span class="eb">model</span> (NOT <span class="eb">man</span>) or <span class="eb">a woman</span>/<span class="eb">female</span> <span class="eb">doctor</span>/<span class="eb">barrister</span>/<span class="eb">driver</span>. However this is now not usually used unless you need to emphasize which sex the person is, or it is still unusual for the job to be done by a man/​woman: <span class="x">My daughter prefers to see a woman doctor.</span><span class="x">They have a male nanny for their kids.</span><span class="x">a female racing driver</span></span></span><span class="h2">Pronouns</span><span class="bullet"><span class="li"> <span class="eb">He</span> used to be considered to cover both men and women: <span class="x">Everyone needs to feel he is loved.</span> This is not now acceptable. Instead, after <span class="eb">everybody</span>, <span class="eb">everyone</span>, <span class="eb">anybody</span>, <span class="eb">anyone</span>, <span class="eb">somebody</span>, <span class="eb">someone</span>, etc. one of the plural pronouns <span class="eb">they</span>, <span class="eb">them</span>, and <span class="eb">their</span> is often used: <span class="x">Does everybody know what they want?</span><span class="x">Somebody’s left their coat here.</span><span class="x">I hope nobody’s forgotten to bring their passport with them.</span></span><span class="li"> Some people prefer to use <span class="eb">he or she</span>, <span class="eb">his or her</span>, or <span class="eb">him or her</span> in speech and writing: <span class="x">Everyone knows what’s best for him or herself.</span> <span class="eb">He/​she</span> or <span class="eb">(s)he</span> can also be used in writing: <span class="x">If in doubt, ask your doctor. He/​she can give you more information.</span> (You may find that some writers just use ‘she’.) These uses can seem awkward when they are used a lot. It is better to try to change the sentence, using a plural noun. Instead of saying: <span class="x">A baby cries when he or she is tired</span> you can say <span class="x">Babies cry when they are tired.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#9e40f75ab2c640959c0f9ede7ff7932f" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2</span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">uncountable</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">the state of being a person rather than a god, an animal or a machine</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">The story was used to emphasize the humanity of Jesus.</span></span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">united by a sense of common humanity</span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#9e40f75ab2c640959c0f9ede7ff7932f" class="sen"></a><span class="num">3</span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">uncountable</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">the quality of being kind to people and animals by making sure that they do not suffer more than is necessary; the quality of being <span class="ndv">humane</span></span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">The judge was praised for his courage and humanity.</span></span></span></span> <span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">opposite</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://inhumanity" otitle="inhumanity definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">inhumanity</span></span></a></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#9e40f75ab2c640959c0f9ede7ff7932f" class="sen"></a><span class="num">4</span> <span class="v-gs" type="alt"><span class="v-g"><span class="v"><strong>(the) humanities</strong></span></span></span> <span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">plural</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">the subjects of study that are concerned with the way people think and behave, for example literature, language, history and philosophy</span> <span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">compare</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://science" otitle="science definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">science</span></span></a></span> </li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Middle English</span></span>: from <span class="lang">Old French</span> <span class="ff">humanite</span>, from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">humanitas</span>, from <span class="ff">humanus</span>, from <span class="ff">homo</span> ‘man, human being’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">All the streets around the temple were just a mass of humanity.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He was found guilty of crimes against humanity.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">It is because I care about the future of humanity that I’m conducting this research.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She was told her son had died in the service of humanity.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
