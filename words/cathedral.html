Their tower or spire <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a cone-shaped structure on top of a small tower<span class="wrap">)</span></span> can often be seen from far away. Churches are used for worship by the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Church of England</span>, <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Roman Catholics</span> and other groups, while some <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Nonconformist Churches</span> use chapels or halls. The church and <span class="eb">church hall</span>, a building used for meetings and <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Sunday School</span>, were formerly the centre of the community. Now, far fewer people attend church and this has resulted in some churches being closed or used for other purposes such as housing.</span><span class="p">Cathedrals may belong to either the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church. Many cathedrals were built as part of a monastery, for example <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Durham</span> was started in the 11th century by Benedictine monks. Some of these cathedrals are called <span class="eb">minsters</span>, e.g. <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">York Minster</span></span>, and they were originally centres for teaching Christianity. St Chad's in Birmingham dates from the middle of the 19th century and was the first Roman Catholic cathedral built in England since the Reformation. A cathedral is the headquarters of a <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">bishop</span> or <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">archbishop</span>. Canterbury Cathedral is the headquarters of the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Archbishop of Canterbury</span></span>, who is head of the Church of England.</span><span class="p">Many people visit churches and cathedrals to admire their architecture. In Britain churches are usually built of stone, with a <span class="eb">tower</span> or <span class="eb">spire</span> at the west end. <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Bells</span> are placed high up in the tower and rung by long ropes before services. In villages the church is approached through a gate, sometimes a <span class="eb">lychgate</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a gate with a roof over it<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, which leads into the <span class="eb">churchyard</span> where people are buried. The main entrance is usually on the south side. The church <span class="eb">porch</span> has a noticeboard and often a seat in it. Cathedrals are large churches, usually built in the shape of a long cross with a central tower. Older cathedrals are often in a quiet grassy <span class="eb">cathedral close</span>.</span><span class="p">The earliest stone churches date from the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Anglo-Saxon</span> period (6th-11th centuries). <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Norman</span> churches, from the 11th and 12th centuries, are massive structures. Rounded arches over doorways and windows are a distinctive feature of Norman architecture. Examples of Norman cathedrals are those at Durham and Ely.</span><span class="p">The English <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Gothic</span> style of the 13th-15th centuries is characterized by pointed arches and increasingly ornate designs for the vault. Windows were tall and narrow in the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Early English</span></span> period (13th century), and later, in the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Decorated</span> period, had tracery <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> lace-like patterns<span class="wrap">)</span></span> at the top. In the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Perpendicular</span> period (15th century), they were greatly increased in size and filled with <span class="eb">stained glass</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> small pieces of coloured glass in a lead frame<span class="wrap">)</span></span> showing pictures of saints. Ceilings with elaborate <span class="eb">fan vaults</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> curved strips of stone spreading out from a point, with patterns between them<span class="wrap">)</span></span> are supported by <span class="eb">flying buttresses</span> that lean at an angle from the wall and form an arch. Salisbury Cathedral is a characteristic Early English building. Exeter Cathedral dates mainly from the Decorated period and Gloucester Cathedral with its fan vaults is typical of the Perpendicular period.</span><span class="p">Some later buildings, such as <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">St Paul's Cathedral</span></span> designed by Christopher <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Wren</span>, are more like classical temples, with a central dome and spire added. Wren and James Gibbs, designer of <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">St Martin-in-the-Fields</span></span>, influenced architects in America: Christ Church in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Philadelphia</span> is a copy of St Martin. But the modern Coventry Cathedral, designed by Basil Spence in the 1950s, is a hall-like church with narrow stained-glass windows.</span><span class="p">In the US the earliest churches were one-room buildings made of wood that were used also as schools. Most communities now have several churches in varying styles. Some are made of stone in order to look like old English churches, some are small, plain buildings made of brick or wood, and others are modern buildings with glass walls. <span class="eb">Storefront churches</span> are found in shopping streets and look like shops/​stores.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Middle English</span></span> (as an adjective, the noun being short for <span class="etym_i">cathedral church</span>, <span class="qt">‘the church which contains the bishop's throne’</span>): from <span class="lang">late Latin</span> <span class="ff">cathedralis</span>, from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">cathedra</span> ‘seat’, from <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="ff">kathedra</span>.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The great Gothic cathedral dominates the city.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We went to mass in the cathedral.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">St Paul’s Cathedral</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
