Some of the larger festivals last several weeks and include music, drama, art and literature. People travel a long way to hear the top international performers that such festivals attract. Smaller festivals concentrate on one art form, such as poetry. Because the US is so large, most of its festivals are local, although a few famous ones, such as the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Monterey Jazz Festival</span> in California, attract people from around the world. Americans most like summer festivals where they can enjoy art, music and food outdoors.</span><span class="p">Many festivals try to obtain <span class="ndv">sponsorship</span> from local businesses to help cover the costs. In the US events are relatively cheap so the entire family can spend the day out. In Britain, however, tickets may be expensive. This tends to restrict the number and type of people who go to the main festivals, and many <span class="eb">festival-goers</span> are middle-aged, middle-class professional people. This in turn can affect the type of music or drama that the organizers put on.</span><span class="p">Some festivals, such as the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Edinburgh Festival</span></span>, have been running for many years. A special feature of the Edinburgh Festival is the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Fringe</span>. Fringe events are usually <span class="ndv">avant-garde</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> experimental<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and attract a wide audience. They also get a lot of attention from the <span class="ndv">critics</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> people who write about new theatre productions, etc. in newspapers and magazines<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, and this can help the careers of younger performers. In Wales, several <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">eisteddfod s</span> celebrate Welsh culture and include competitions for <span class="ndv">composers</span> and artists. In the US the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Carmel</span> Performing Arts Festival in California offers a range of music, dance, theatre, stories and poetry.</span><span class="p">Many festivals concentrate on music. In Britain, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Aldeburgh Festival</span></span> was founded by <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Benjamin Britten</span></span>. The most famous British music festival, however, is the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Proms</span>, held each summer at the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Royal Albert Hall</span></span> in London. Concerts contain a mixture of old favourites and new, specially <span class="ndv">commissioned</span> pieces. Classical music is less popular in the US, but several festivals offer a mixture of concerts and classes, e.g. the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Aspen</span> Music Festival.</span><span class="p">Festivals of rock and pop music are often huge informal <span class="ndv">open-air</span> events attended by thousands of people, many of whom camp overnight in a nearby field. The biggest rock festivals in Britain include <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Glastonbury</span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Reading</span> and the Download festival, Donnington. There are huge numbers of festivals every year across the US for different types of music. These include <span class="eb">Rock Fests</span>, for example the one held near Cadott, Wisconsin and the Southwest Louisiana Zydeco Music Festival, which celebrates the music (and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Cajun</span> food) of Black French and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Creole</span> peoples. The Beale Street Music Festival in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Memphis</span> and the W C Handy Blues and Barbecue Festival in Henderson, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Kentucky</span>, celebrate the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">blues</span>.</span><span class="p">Film festivals are especially popular in the US. The best known is the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Sundance Film Festival</span></span> in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Utah</span>. The Hollywood Film Festival attracts big stars, but America's mix of people from different races and cultures has led to many smaller events such as the Boston Jewish Film Festival and the Los Angeles Asian-Pacific Film Festival. The main event in Britain is the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">London Film Festival</span></span>, run by the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">BFI</span> (British Film Institute). There is also the Celtic Film and Television Festival, which promotes <span class="ndv">Celtic</span> languages and cultures and takes place in a different town each year in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Cornwall</span>, Ireland, Scotland, Wales or Brittany.</span><span class="p">Fewer people generally attend literature festivals, but in the US the annual Tennessee Williams/​New Orleans Literary Festival has become a major event. It includes performances of Williams's plays and a walking tour of Williams's New Orleans. The Dodge Poetry Festival is held every two years in New Jersey. In Britain the town of Hay-on-Wye has a literary festival, and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Stratford-upon-Avon</span></span> has a poetry festival every summer.</span><span class="p">In the US the most common festivals are arts, or arts and crafts, festivals. For example, the Utah Arts Festival mixes art with music, theatre and cooking.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a href="entry://#9914284f9a4a417cba117fc5ffdc67f2" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2 </span><span class="sym_first"> <a class="oxford3000 no-href">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="def">a day or period of the year when people stop working to celebrate a special event, often a religious one</span></li> <span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">see also</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://harvest festival" otitle="harvest festival definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">harvest festival</span></span></a></span></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Middle English</span></span> (as an adjective): via <span class="lang">Old French</span> from <span class="lang">medieval Latin</span> <span class="ff">festivalis</span>, from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">festivus</span>, from <span class="ff">festum</span>, (plural) <span class="ff">festa</span> ‘feast’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He’s appearing at a local folk festival tonight.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I like to play any big festivals.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The dance troupe will open the festival on June 13.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The family always celebrates the Jewish festivals.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The festival attracts thousands of visitors every year.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The school has taken part in the festival since 1997.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a festival featuring five local bands</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the events in this year’s festival</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the film festival circuit</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the movies shown during the eight-day festival</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the pilgrims who arrived on major festivals</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
