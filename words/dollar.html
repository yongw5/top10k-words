The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Department of the Treasury</span></span> prints <span class="eb">bills</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> paper money<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in various <span class="eb">denominations</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> values<span class="wrap">)</span></span>: $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. US bills are all the same size, whatever their value, and measure about 2×6 inches/6.5×15.5 centimetres. All are green and are sometimes called <span class="eb">greenbacks</span>. On the front, each has a picture of a famous American. The <span class="eb">dollar bill</span>, for instance, shows George <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Washington</span>, the first US president. An informal name for dollars is <span class="eb">bucks</span>, because in the early period of US history people traded the skins of bucks <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> deer<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and prices would sometimes be given as a number of buckskins. Buck refers to the dollar itself, and not to the bill. So although you can say 'He earns 500 bucks a week', you have to say ‘If I give you four quarters could you give me a dollar bill?’</span><span class="p">The Treasury also makes US coins: <span class="eb">pennies</span> which are worth .01 of a dollar, <span class="eb">nickels</span> (.05), <span class="eb">dimes</span> (.10) and <span class="eb">quarters</span> (.25). There are also <span class="eb">half dollars</span> (.50) and <span class="eb">silver dollars</span> but these are not often seen. Pennies have a dark brown colour; all the other coins have a silver appearance.</span><span class="p">When you write an amount in figures the <span class="eb">dollar sign ($)</span> goes to the left of the amount and a decimal point (.) is placed between the dollars and the <span class="eb">cents</span>. If the amount is less than one dollar, the <span class="eb">cent sign (¢)</span> is put after the numbers. So you write $5, $5.62 and 62¢.</span><span class="p">Britain's currency is the <span class="eb">pound sterling</span>, written as <span class="eb">£</span> before a figure. A pound consists of 100 <span class="eb">pence</span>, written as <span class="eb">p</span> with figures. Pound coins are round and gold-coloured. They have the Queen's head on one side and one of four designs, English, Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish, on the other. The £2 coin is silver-coloured with a gold edge. Coins of lower value are the silver-coloured 50p, 20p, 10p and 5p <span class="eb">pieces</span>, and the copper-coloured 2p and 1p pieces. All are round, except for the 50p and 20p pieces which have seven curved sides. Coins are made at the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Royal Mint</span></span>. Paper <span class="eb">notes</span> (not bills), which have the Queen's head on one side and a famous person on the other, are worth £5, £10, £20 or £50.</span><span class="p">A pound is informally called a <span class="eb">quid</span>, a £5 note is a <span class="eb">fiver</span>, a £10 note is a <span class="eb">tenner</span>. Scottish <span class="eb">banknotes</span> have their own designs. They can be used anywhere in Britain, though shops can legally refuse to accept them. To prevent people <span class="eb">forging</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> making their own<span class="wrap">)</span></span> paper money, designs are complicated and difficult to copy. To check that a note is genuine, a shop assistant may hold it up to the light to see if it has a narrow silver thread running through it.</span><span class="p">The <span class="eb">decimal system</span> now in use in Britain replaced the old <span class="eb">pounds, shilling</span> and <span class="eb">pence</span>, or LSD system in 1971. Formerly there were 12 pence or <span class="eb">pennies</span> in a <span class="eb">shilling</span>, and 20 shillings in a pound. The old coins included the <span class="eb">farthing</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a quarter of a penny<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and the <span class="eb">half-crown</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> two shillings and sixpence<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. There were notes for 10 shillings, £1 and £5.</span><span class="p">Gold <span class="eb">guinea</span> coins were used in the 18th century and were worth 21 shillings. Until 1971 prices were often set in guineas instead of pounds for luxury items, such as antiques and jewellery, for the fees of doctors, lawyers, etc., and at auctions, though the guinea coin had long since gone <span class="eb">out of circulation</span>. Some racehorses are still auctioned in guineas.</span><span class="p">On 1 January 1999 the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">euro</span> system was introduced in 11 countries of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">European Union</span>. Britain chose not to be part of this first group and no date was fixed for Britain to start using the euro. However, many British businesses have euro bank accounts so as to be able to pay for goods and be paid in euros and a few shops in Britain accept payment in euros.</span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a href="entry://#e01020cd6b374aec89a7df3beb45853e" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2 </span><span class="sym_first"> <a class="oxford3000 no-href">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">countable</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">a <span class="ndv">banknote</span> or coin worth one dollar</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">Do you have a dollar?</span></span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a dollar bill</span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#e01020cd6b374aec89a7df3beb45853e" class="sen"></a><span class="num">3</span><span class="v-gs" type="alt"><span class="v-g"><span class="v"><strong>the dollar</strong></span></span></span> <span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">singular</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="label-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="subj">finance</span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">the value of the US dollar compared with the value of the money of other countries</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">The dollar closed two cents down.</span></span></span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body">from <span class="lang">early Flemish</span> or <span class="lang">Low German</span> <span class="ff">daler</span>, from <span class="lang">German</span> <span class="ff">T(h)aler</span>, short for <span class="ff">Joachimsthaler</span>, a coin from the silver mine of <span class="n">Joachimsthal</span> (‘Joachim's valley’), now <span class="n">Jáchymov</span> in the Czech Republic.
