Hockey played on ice is called <span class="eb">ice hockey</span>. In the US ice hockey is much more common and is called simply <span class="ei">hockey</span>. Both sports are played by both men and women.</span><span class="p">In field hockey there are 11 players in each team, five <span class="eb">forwards</span>, three <span class="eb">halfbacks</span>, two <span class="eb">fullbacks</span> and a <span class="eb">goalkeeper</span>. A <span class="eb">hockey pitch</span> (<span class="ei">AmE</span> <span class="eb">hockey field</span>) is 100 yards/91 metres long and between 55 and 60 yards/50 and 55 metres wide. There is a <span class="eb">goal</span> at each end. The aim of the game is to hit a small white ball into the other team's goal with wooden <span class="eb">hockey sticks</span>. A goal is worth one point. Each game has two halves of 35 minutes. A game begins with a <span class="eb">pass-back</span>: a forward hits the ball but it is not allowed to cross the centre line until another player from either team has also hit it. There is also an <span class="eb">indoor</span> game of hockey played with six in each team.</span><span class="p">The modern game developed in England in the mid 19th century, and the first hockey club was formed in 1849. English clubs are now organized into a league with a <span class="eb">Premier Division</span> and three regional divisions. The Scottish Hockey Union runs leagues in Scotland. The sport is not shown on television as much as <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">cricket</span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Rugby</span> or <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">football</span> and most people could not name any famous hockey players. Hockey is a game traditionally played at girls' schools. In Britain ice hockey attracts relatively little interest.</span><span class="p">An English teacher visiting <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Harvard</span> introduced the sport to the US in 1901. At first it was played only by women, and the first men's game was not until 1928. In the US the game is controlled by the USA Field Hockey Association. It is less popular than in Britain.</span><span class="p">By contrast, ice hockey, first played in Canada, has long been popular in the US. It is a fast and exciting sport. Each team has six players, a <span class="eb">centre</span>, two <span class="eb">forwards</span> and two <span class="eb">wingers</span>, all of whom try to score, and a <span class="eb">goalkeeper</span>. Players wear <span class="eb">skates</span>, and have <span class="eb">helmets</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> hard round hats<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, <span class="eb">gloves</span> and <span class="eb">pads</span> for protection. They use long wooden <span class="eb">sticks</span> to hit the <span class="eb">puck</span>, a small, hard rubber disc, into the opponent's goal. If they succeed they score one point. The area of the <span class="eb">rink</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> iced surface on which the game is played<span class="wrap">)</span></span> is up to 67 yards/61 metres long and 33 yards/30 metres wide, and is divided into an attacking zone, a neutral zone and a defending zone.</span><span class="p">A game has three 20-minute <span class="eb">periods</span>. Play begins with a <span class="eb">face-off</span> when the <span class="eb">referee</span> drops the puck between two opposing players. <span class="eb">Defenders</span> try to prevent the opposing team from scoring and can <span class="eb">check</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> crash into<span class="wrap">)</span></span> another player with their bodies. Professional players often have fights on the ice, and the game has been criticized for being too violent. A player who commits an illegal action goes to the <span class="eb">penalty box</span>, informally called the <span class="eb">sin bin</span>, for a period of between 2 and 10 minutes and the team must continue without him or her.</span><span class="p">The US <span class="eb">National Hockey League</span> has 30 teams, six of which are Canadian. The best teams in the <span class="eb">Eastern Conference</span> and the <span class="eb">Western Conference</span> play to decide which two will be in the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Stanley Cup</span></span>. The Hart Memorial Trophy is given to the best player, and Wayne Gretzky, thought by many to be the greatest ice hockey player ever, won it eight times in the period 1980-7 and in 1989. Among the most successful teams have been the New York Islanders and the Detroit Red Wings. In the northern states college and university teams compete in three <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">NCAA</span> divisions.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def">early 16th cent.</span>: of unknown origin.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He plays in the college hockey team.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She plays hockey in the winter.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the Olympic hockey squad</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
