Political parties, charities and other organizations also use advertising. Many pages in newspapers and magazines are filled with advertisements (also called <span class="eb">ads</span> or, in Britain, <span class="eb">adverts</span>), companies advertise on the Internet and there are also advertisements, usually called <span class="eb">commercials</span>, on radio and television. Especially in the US, supermarkets and other stores produce <span class="eb">leaflets</span>, often made up of several pages, showing pictures of items that are <span class="eb">special offers</span> that week.</span><span class="p">Advertisements in newspapers and magazines are expensive and only the largest companies can afford to advertise their products in this way. Many organizations, however, use newspapers to advertise jobs and these are generally grouped together in the <span class="eb">jobs section</span>. Small companies advertise in the <span class="eb">classified ads</span> columns, where each advertisement consists of a few lines of text only. Shops and businesses, and individuals wanting to buy or sell used household goods, advertise in local papers.</span><span class="p">The wealthiest companies buy advertising time on television. Famous actors or singers sometimes <span class="eb">endorse</span> a particular product by appearing in advertisements for it. Some advertising <span class="eb">slogans</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> short phrases mentioning a product<span class="wrap">)</span></span> are known by everyone, e.g. ‘Have a break – have a <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Kit Kat</span></span>.’ Some advertisements are like very brief <span class="ndv">episodes</span> of a story. Tobacco advertising is now banned on radio and television in Britain and the US. Advertisers have no influence over the people who make programmes, even if they help pay for the programmes through <span class="ndv">sponsorship</span>. There is, however, an increasing amount of <span class="eb">product placement</span>, where firms pay for their products to be shown in films or television programmes. In the US some commercials are national, others are shown only in a particular area. Some products are sold on smaller channels by an <span class="eb">infomercial</span>, a commercial that lasts half an hour or more and tries to look like an entertainment programme.</span><span class="p">Other ways of advertising include displaying large posters on <span class="eb">hoardings</span> or <span class="eb">billboards</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> large signs<span class="wrap">)</span></span> by the side of roads. <span class="eb">Flyers</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> small posters<span class="wrap">)</span></span> advertising local events, for example, are given to people in the street. Restaurants advertise in theatre programmes, and shops advertise in their own magazines or on their shopping <span class="ndv">trolleys</span> (<span class="ei">AmE</span> carts). Many companies advertise on the Internet.</span><span class="p">The biggest US <span class="eb">ad agencies</span> have offices in New York on <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Madison Avenue</span>, so <span class="eb">Madison Avenue</span> has come to mean the advertising industry. In Britain, the advertising industry is controlled by the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Advertising Standards Authority</span></span>. All advertisements must be ‘legal, decent, honest and truthful’. In the US the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Federal Communications Commission</span></span> makes rules about advertising. Television and radio stations are required to do some <span class="eb">public service announcements</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> commercials that give information to the community<span class="wrap">)</span></span> free of charge.</span><span class="p">There are many forms of advertising on the Internet. Just as firms send <span class="eb">junk mail</span> to people who have not asked for it, emails are used to advertise products and services. Unwanted emails are called <span class="eb">spam</span>. On Internet pages advertisers use <span class="eb">banner ads</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> advertisements across the top or bottom of a page<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, <span class="eb">pop-ups</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> pages that open in front of the page you are looking at<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and links to their own websites to attract customers. Advertisements are also sent to mobile/​cell phones.</span><span class="p">Many people are against advertising, partly because it adds to the cost of a product. People also say that the influence of advertising is too great, and that children, especially, want every product they see advertised. On the other hand, many people buy American newspapers on Sundays because they advertise <span class="eb">special offers</span> and contain <span class="eb">coupons</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> pieces of paper enabling people to buy products at a reduced price<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a href="entry://#3ff513c2f76748c18e2e002a3ca25bd9" class="sen"></a><span class="num">3 </span><span class="sym_first"> <a class="oxford3000 no-href">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">often passive</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">to move somebody to a higher rank or more senior job</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="cf"><span class="exp">promote</span> somebody</span> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">She worked hard and was soon promoted.</span></span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="cf"><span class="exp">promote</span> somebody (from something) (to something)</span> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">He has been promoted to sergeant.</span></span></span></span> <span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">opposite</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://demote" otitle="demote definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">demote</span></span></a></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#3ff513c2f76748c18e2e002a3ca25bd9" class="sen"></a><span class="num">4</span><span class="cf"><span class="exp">promote</span> something (from something) (to something)</span> <span class="def">to move a sports team from playing with one group of teams to playing in a better group</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">They were promoted to the First Division last season.</span></span></span></span> <span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">opposite</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://relegate" otitle="relegate definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">relegate</span></span></a></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">late Middle English</span></span>: from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">promot-</span> ‘moved forward’, from the verb <span class="ff">promovere</span>, from <span class="ff">pro-</span> ‘forward, onward’ + <span class="ff">movere</span> ‘to move’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Basketball stars have helped promote the sport overseas.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Bonus payments to staff serve to promote commitment to the company.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He was promoted from deputy minister to minister last year.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He was promoted to the rank of captain.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Human rights are strongly promoted by all our members.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The company’s products have been promoted mainly through advertising in newspapers.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The country is now being promoted as a travel destination.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The idea of equal opportunities was strongly promoted by many Labour MPs.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The new products have been very heavily promoted.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">They claimed that the authorities had deliberately promoted and condoned the violence.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Young people’s awareness of agricultural issues is promoted through publicity material.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a recently promoted headteacher</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">measures designed to promote economic growth</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Basketball stars from the US have helped promote the sport in Italy and Spain.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The aim of the culture festival is to promote friendship between the two countries.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The church tries to promote racial harmony.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
