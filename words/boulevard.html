An <span class="ndv">exception</span> is the A1 from London to north-eastern England, which is often called the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Great North Road</span></span>. Roads that follow the line of former <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Roman roads</span> also have names, e.g. the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Fosse Way</span></span>. If a main road passes through a town, that part of it usually has a name, often that of the place which the road goes to, e.g. London Road.</span><span class="p">The main shopping street in a town is often called High Street, or sometimes Market Street. Many streets take their name from a local feature or building. The most common include Bridge Street, Castle Street, Church Street, Mill Street and Station Road. Some names indicate the trade that was formerly carried on in that area. Examples are Candlemaker's Row, Cornmarket, Petticoat Lane and Sheep Street. Many streets laid out in the 19th century were named after famous people or events. These include Albert Street, Cromwell Road, Shakespeare Street, Wellington Street, Trafalgar Road and Waterloo Street. When <span class="ndv">housing estates</span> are built, the names of the new roads in them are usually all on the same theme. Names of birds or animals are popular. Others are based on the old names for the fields that the houses were built on, e.g. Tenacres Road, The Slade and Meadow Walk. The name of a road is written on signs at each end of it, sometimes together with the local <span class="ndv">postcode</span>.</span><span class="p">Some streets have become so closely identified with people of a particular profession that the street name itself is immediately associated with them. In London, <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Harley Street</span> has been associated with private doctors and <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Fleet Street</span> with newspapers.</span><span class="p">In the US main roads such as <span class="ndv">interstates</span> and <span class="ndv">highways</span> are known by numbers. Most towns and cities are laid out on a <span class="eb">grid</span> pattern and have long <span class="eb">streets</span> with <span class="eb">avenues</span> crossing them. Each has a number, e.g. 7th Avenue, 42nd Street. The roads are often straight and have square <span class="eb">blocks</span> of buildings between them. This makes it easier to find an address and also helps people to judge distance. In <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Manhattan</span>, for example, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Tiffany's</span> is described as being at East 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, i.e. on the corner of those two streets. The distance between West 90th Street and West 60th Street is 30 blocks.</span><span class="p">As well as having numbers, many streets are named after people, places, local features, history and nature. In Manhattan there is Washington Street, Lexington Avenue, Liberty Street, Church Street and Cedar Street. Some streets are named after the town to which they lead. The most important street is often called <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Main Street</span>. A <span class="eb">suburb</span> or <span class="eb">subdivision</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> group of houses built together in a section of a city<span class="wrap">)</span></span> of a city may have streets with similar names. In a subdivision of Baton Rouge, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Louisiana</span>, all the names end in ‚wood‘, e.g. Balsawood Drive, Limewood Drive and Aspenwood Drive.</span><span class="p">Some roads are called boulevards, with <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Hollywood's</span> <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Sunset Boulevard</span></span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Miami's</span> Biscayne Boulevard among the best known. Avenues usually cross streets, as in New York, but often the word is chosen as part of a name for no particular reason. <span class="ei">Avenue</span> and <span class="ei">boulevard</span> once indicated roads with trees along each side, but few have trees today. A <span class="ei">road</span> in the US is usually found outside cities, though Chicago uses the name for some central streets.</span><span class="p">Some street names have particular associations: Grant Avenue in <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">San Francisco</span></span> is associated with <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Chinatown</span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Beale Street</span></span> in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Memphis</span> with the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">blues</span>, and Bourbon Street in New Orleans with <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">jazz</span>. In New York <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Wall Street</span> is associated with the financial world, <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Madison Avenue</span> with <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">advertising</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Broadway</span> with theatres.</span></span></span></span> </li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def">mid 18th cent.</span>: <span class="lang">French</span>, ‘a rampart’ (later ‘a promenade on the site of one’), from <span class="lang">German</span> <span class="ff">Bollwerk</span> from <span class="lang">Middle Low German</span> and <span class="lang">Middle Dutch</span> <span class="ff">bolwerk</span>; related to <span class="xr"><span class="xh">bole</span></span> and <span class="xr"><span class="xh">work</span></span>.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">They sauntered along the tree-lined boulevard.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a boulevard lined with cafes</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">A number of little cafes lined the sunny boulevard.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">A police car sped down the crowded boulevard.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">It is a city of broad boulevards and spacious parks.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We visited the world-famous Hollywood Boulevard.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
