Most universities and employers still rely mainly on exam results for evidence of a person's academic ability.</span><span class="p">Children in England complete <span class="eb">National Curriculum Tests</span>, (still sometimes called by their former name, <span class="eb">standard assessment tasks</span> or <span class="eb">SATs</span>) at ages 7 and 11 as part of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">National Curriculum</span>. These tests are set <span class="ndv">nationally</span> and results can be compared across the country. In a very few areas children take an <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">eleven-plus</span> exam to decide where they will go for their secondary education.</span><span class="p">In secondary schools exams are usually held at the end of each school year to assess students' progress. The most important exams are the national <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">GCSE</span> exams that children take at 16. Schools are free to choose which of several <span class="eb">examination boards</span> they use to set and mark GCSE exams. Exams are marked on a seven-point scale, A to G, with an additional grade, A*, being awarded to those who reach the highest standard and U for 'unclassified'. Final grades may also be based on <span class="eb">continuous assessment</span>, i.e. marks gained for essays and project work during the course, as well as on a student's performance in the exam. Many students take GCSE exams in seven or eight subjects, sometimes more. <span class="eb">Diploma</span> exams offer an alternative to GCSE and A level exams and are based on more practical work as preparation for particular jobs.<span class="ndv" type="singlewd">BTECs</span> (Business and Technician Education Council) and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">NVQs</span>(National Vocational Qualifications) are other less academic alternatives to GCSEs and A levels.</span><span class="p">Students who do well in their GCSEs usually go on to take <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">A level</span> exams two years later. Exams are marked on a five-point scale, A to E, with an additional grade, A*, and U for ‘unclassified’, as at GCSE. Most study four or five subjects at AS level in the first year and then three at A2 level in the second year. They must achieve reasonably high grades in order to be offered a place at university.</span><span class="p">In Scotland students sit <span class="eb">Scottish Qualifications Certificate</span> exams which, at <span class="eb">Standard Grade</span>, are the equivalent of GCSEs. The highest grade is A. A year later students take the higher grade, <span class="eb">Highers</span>. After a further year some students take <span class="eb">Advanced Highers</span>.</span><span class="p">Students from other countries who wish to study at university in Britain must show a knowledge of English and the most common test for this purpose is an <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">IELTS</span> test.</span><span class="p">At university students work towards a <span class="eb">degree</span>, and most courses end in a series of exams called <span class="eb">finals</span>. Many take an <span class="eb">honours degree</span> which is awarded in one of several <span class="eb">classes</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> grades<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. The highest class is a first. The second class is often split between upper second and lower second (a 2:1 and a 2:2), and below that is the third class. If a student does not meet the standard for an honours degree, he or she may be awarded a <span class="eb">pass degree</span>.</span><span class="p">In the US there are no national exams like those in Britain. Students at school and university usually take one or more exams as part of their <span class="eb">grade assessment</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a mark from A to E or F showing how well they have done<span class="wrap">)</span></span> for each class. At colleges and universities these exams are often called <span class="eb">midterms</span> or <span class="eb">finals</span>, and during the year students have exams in all or most of their classes.</span><span class="p">People who wish to study at a US university usually have to take one of several <span class="eb">standardized tests</span>. Students going to university for the first time may take the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">SAT</span> (<span class="eb">Scholastic Aptitude Test</span>) or the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">ACT</span> (<span class="eb">American College Test</span>). People who want to do a higher degree may take the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">GRE</span> (<span class="eb">Graduate Record Examination</span>), <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">LSAT</span> (<span class="eb">Law School Admission Test</span>) or <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">MCAT</span> (<span class="eb">Medical College Admission Test</span>), depending on what they want to study. Students from other countries must usually show a knowledge of English and the most common test for this purpose is the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">TOEFL</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> Test of English as a Foreign Language<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Standardized tests often do not test how much people know about a subject, but how strong their skills are in areas like reading and solving problems. People do not pass or fail but instead each college or university decides on the lowest score it will accept. Test scores are never the only factor to be considered in deciding whether to offer a place to a student.</span><span class="p">Some professions require people to pass special exams before they are qualified to practise. Lawyers in the US, for example, must pass the <span class="eb">bar exam</span> in the state in which they wish to work, to show that they know the laws of that state.</span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
