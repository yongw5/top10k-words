England is divided into <span class="eb">counties</span> each with a <span class="eb">county council</span> which is responsible for certain services. Each county is divided again into <span class="eb">districts</span>, each with a <span class="eb">district council</span> responsible for a smaller area. Districts are further divided into <span class="eb">parishes</span> which were originally villages with churches. In some parts of England, there are instead <span class="eb">unitary authorities</span> which have just one level of local government responsible for an area or city, sometimes called a <span class="eb">metropolitan district</span>. London has a separate system with an elected <span class="eb">Assembly</span> and a <span class="eb">mayor</span>. In Scotland, there are 32 <span class="eb">council areas</span>. Wales is divided into 22 counties and <span class="eb">county boroughs</span> and Northern Ireland has 26 districts. All of these are unitary authorities with one level of local government.</span><span class="p">Councils consist of <span class="eb">councillors</span> who are representatives elected by local people for a period of four years. Most councillors belong to a <span class="ndv">political party</span> and, especially at county level, people often vote for them as representatives of a party, not as individuals. Since the Local Government Act of 2000, councils have been led by a <span class="eb">council leader</span> and a <span class="eb">cabinet</span> of councillors, or a <span class="eb">directly elected mayor</span> and a cabinet. Councils meet in a <span class="eb">council chamber</span> at the local <span class="eb">town hall</span> or <span class="eb">county hall</span>.</span><span class="p">Councils make policies for their area which are carried out by <span class="eb">local government officers</span>, who have a similar role to <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">civil servants</span>. <span class="eb">Local authorities</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> councils and committees<span class="wrap">)</span></span> have responsibilities for education, social services, housing, transport, the fire and police services and other local services. Many people are employed by councils, but many services are also now carried out by private companies who are given contracts by the council. Councils receive some money from central government in the form of <span class="eb">grants</span>, they also collect <span class="eb">council tax</span> from each <span class="ndv">household</span>, a locally set tax based on the value of the house.</span><span class="p">In the US, local government has three levels, with the <span class="eb">State government</span>, <span class="eb">County government</span> and below that, towns and cities. State government is organized in a similar way to the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">federal government</span></span>, with a <span class="eb">state constitution</span> in most states which explains the powers of the three branches of state government, the <span class="ndv">executive</span>, the <span class="ndv">legislative</span> and the <span class="ndv">judicial</span>. The <span class="ndv">executive</span> branch is headed by a <span class="eb">governor</span> and state laws are made by a <span class="eb">legislature</span>, which usually has two houses, a <span class="eb">Senate</span> and a <span class="eb">House of Representatives</span>. The <span class="ndv">judicial</span> branch usually consists of a state supreme court and several lower courts. States have great influence and organize their own system of courts and set local <span class="ndv">income tax</span> and sales tax.</span><span class="p">States are divided into counties which have a county government located in a town or city called the <span class="eb">county seat</span>. The structure of county government varies from state to state, but most countries have a <span class="eb">Board of Commissioners</span>, sometimes called a <span class="eb">Board of Supervisors</span>, with the Board and other county officials usually being elected. Services provided by a county government depend on the area, whether it is mainly urban or rural. In urban areas, city and county governments may work together to provide services for the area. Counties usually have a <span class="eb">sheriff's department</span>, a kind of police department, whose officers are called <span class="eb">sheriff's deputies</span>.</span><span class="p">America's cities, towns and other <span class="eb">municipalities</span> vary greatly from small towns of a few hundred people to cities of millions. For that reason, there is no single system of local government. Most towns and cities have an elected mayor as their head and a council, made up of elected members from different areas of the city, which makes <span class="eb">ordinances</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> local laws<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. A <span class="eb">municipal government</span> usually has its own police force and courts, runs local schools, takes care of the roads, and may also provide services like public transport, water and electricity.</span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a href="entry://#db8cf0ad2f4442eb86f00069ff669434" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2 </span><span class="sym_first"> <a class="oxford3000 no-href">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="label-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="geo" geo="br">British English</span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">the organization that provides services in a city or county, for example education, houses, libraries, etc.</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x"><span class="cl"><strong>council workers/services</strong></span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#db8cf0ad2f4442eb86f00069ff669434" class="sen"></a><span class="num">3</span><span class="def">a group of people chosen to give advice, make rules, do research, provide money, etc.</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the Medical Research Council</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">In Britain, the Arts Council gives grants to theatres.</span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#db8cf0ad2f4442eb86f00069ff669434" class="sen"></a><span class="num">4</span><span class="label-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="reg">formal</span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">(especially in the past) a formal meeting to discuss what action to take in a particular situation</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">The King held a council at Nottingham from 14 to 19 October 1330.</span></span></span></span></li> <span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">see also</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://the privy council" otitle="Privy Council definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">Privy Council</span></span></a></span></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Old English</span></span> (in the sense <span class="qt">‘ecclesiastical assembly’</span>): from <span class="lang">Anglo-Norman French</span> <span class="ff">cuncile</span>, from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">concilium</span> ‘convocation, assembly’, from <span class="ff">con-</span> ‘together’ + <span class="ff">calare</span> ‘summon’.
