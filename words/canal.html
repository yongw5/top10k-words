They provided a cheap and convenient means of transport for heavy goods, especially between the mining and industrial centres of the Midlands and north-west England. Coal, grain, clay and other materials were transported on <span class="eb">narrowboats</span>, also called <span class="eb">barges</span>, that were pulled along by horses walking along a <span class="eb">towpath</span> beside the canal. Many miles of channel had to be dug, with some sections passing through tunnels or over <span class="eb">aqueducts</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> long, high bridges across valleys<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Hundreds of <span class="eb">locks</span> were built to enable boats to go up or down a hill. A <span class="eb">flight</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> series<span class="wrap">)</span></span> of 20 or 30 locks was needed on some steep sections.</span><span class="p">In the US canals were used for a short period to transport goods to areas where there were no large rivers. The most famous, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Erie Canal</span></span> in New York State, ran from Buffalo on <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Lake Erie</span></span> to Albany on the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Hudson River</span></span> and connected New York City with <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Ohio</span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Michigan</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Pennsylvania</span>. Mules, not horses, were used to pull the barges. The growth of the railway in the 1840s soon took business away from the canals, but the canal system played an important role in expanding trade and encouraging people to move west.</span><span class="p">After the railways were built, many canals were filled in. In Britain especially, canals that still exist have become popular with people wanting a quiet country holiday away from traffic. Old narrow boats have been fitted with motors and converted to provide attractive holiday accommodation. Speed is restricted on canals so the pace is slow and restful. Some locks are operated by <span class="eb">lock-keepers</span>, but many are <span class="eb">worked</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> opened and closed<span class="wrap">)</span></span> by people on the boats. Going through a flight of locks is seen as part of the fun. At night, people moor their boats at the side of the canal. Canals are also popular with fishermen, and with walkers using the towpath. Many pubs are built beside canals and attract people enjoying a canal holiday or having a day out.</span><span class="p">In Britain, some people live in narrow boats and stay most of the time on a particular stretch of canal. These <span class="eb">houseboats</span> are often painted in bright colours, with pictures of flowers on the side. On the flat roof there are sometimes traditional jugs and pots painted with similar designs.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#5564bfed16b644cf8ac78aa7099ec3f4" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2</span> <span class="def">a tube inside the body through which liquid, food or air can pass</span> <span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">see also</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://alimentary canal" otitle="alimentary canal definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">alimentary canal</span></span></a></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">late Middle English</span></span>: from <span class="lang">Old French</span>, alteration of <span class="ff">chanel</span> ‘channel’, from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">canalis</span> ‘pipe, groove, channel’, from <span class="ff">canna</span> ‘cane’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The barge moved slowly along the canal.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">boats on the canal</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">It is important to keep the irrigation canals clear of vegetation.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The Panama Canal was not opened until after the outbreak of war.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The canal network put Birmingham at the centre of Britain’s transport system in the 1780s.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
