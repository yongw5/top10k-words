It covers an area in east central London north of the River Thames, between Blackfriars Bridge and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Tower Bridge</span></span>. It is only about one square mile/2.5 square kilometres in size and is often referred to as <span class="eb">the Square Mile</span>.</span><span class="p">Many financial institutions have their head offices in the City, including the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Bank of England</span></span> in Threadneedle Street, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">London Stock Exchange</span></span> in Old Broad Street and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Lloyd's of London</span></span> in Lime Street. Many banks, insurance companies and <span class="eb">stockbrokers</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> companies that buy and sell shares for others<span class="wrap">)</span></span> have been in the City many years. When journalists talk about ‘the City’ they are usually not referring to the place but to the people involved in business and <span class="ndv">commerce</span>, as in: <span class="ei">The City had been expecting poor results from the company.</span> In fact, the financial businesses and organizations that are based further east,from the Square Mile, in the area known as <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Canary Wharf</span></span> are also included in this extended use of the term ‘the City’.</span><span class="p">In the City old and new buildings stand next to each other. The most famous older buildings include <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">St Paul's Cathedral</span></span>, the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Guildhall</span> and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Mansion House</span></span>, where the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Lord Mayor</span> of London lives. Tower 42, which is 600 feet/183 metres high, and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Swiss Re Tower</span></span>, nicknamed ‘the Gherkin’, are two of the City's more recent <span class="ndv">landmarks</span>. The <span class="eb">Shard</span> building, on the south side of the Thames, was opened in 2013 and is currently the tallest building in the European Union. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Barbican Centre</span></span> includes an art <span class="ndv">gallery</span>, a theatre and a concert hall, as well as flats/​apartments.</span><span class="p">Few people live in the City and at night the population is about 7 000. During the day it rises to about half a million, as business people <span class="ndv">commute</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> travel from home to work<span class="wrap">)</span></span> to the City by car, bus and train. In the past the traditional image of the <span class="eb">City gent</span> was of a <span class="ndv">businessman</span> in a dark suit and <span class="ndv">bowler hat</span>, carrying a <span class="ndv">briefcase</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a leather case for papers, etc.<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and a newspaper or an umbrella. The expression <span class="ei">She's something in the City</span> means ‘She has an important job with a bank or firm of <span class="ndv">stockbrokers</span> ’, and suggests wealth and high social status.</span></span></span></span></li></span> <span class="sn-gs"> <span class="shcut">work</span><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a href="entry://#38239468434f4a43a2f64cd01238e7b3"
