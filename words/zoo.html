People from other countries often think British and American people are sentimental about animals, and say that they fuss over them and treat them better than human beings.</span><span class="p">At weekends people in Britain often visit <span class="eb">farm parks, safari parks</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> parks where people can drive close to lions, zebras etc.<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, <span class="eb">zoos, bird parks</span> and <span class="eb">sea life centres</span>. In the US there are zoos and <span class="eb">aquaria</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> large tanks of fish<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, which are educational, and also amusement parks with animals, like Busch Gardens and Disney's Animal Kingdom.</span><span class="p">Television programmes about animals are very popular. These range from factual programmes about wildlife to films starring fictional animals. Children are given cuddly toy animals and picture books about animals. Children's literature has created many famous animal characters, such as <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Black Beauty</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Brer Rabbit</span></span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Pooh</span>, and Ratty, Mole and Toad in <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">The Wind in the Willows</span></span>. Many animals in books have their own distinctive character: lions are typically brave, foxes are cunning and cats are proud.</span><span class="p">There are laws against cruelty to animals in Britain and the US. People give generously to animal charities such as the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">RSPCA</span> and the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">ASPCA</span>, and there are <span class="eb">animal hospitals</span> and <span class="eb">rescue centres</span> for injured and abandoned animals. Most of these, and most <span class="eb">zoos</span> are fairly modern, and many animals live in a large <span class="eb">enclosure</span> similar to their natural <span class="eb">habitat</span>, rather than in a cage. Often zoos keep only animals that cannot survive in the wild or were born <span class="eb">in captivity</span>. Some breed animals to put back into the wild and try to raise public awareness about the need for <span class="eb">conservation</span>.</span><span class="p">Many people care about wild animals. People feed wild birds in the winter and some have a bird table in the garden. In the US the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) helps people to create their own 'backyard wildlife habitat'.</span><span class="p">There are often campaigns to save species that are <span class="eb">endangered</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> that may become extinct<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, such as wolves and buffalo in the US, and red squirrels and hedgehogs in Britain. In rural areas people generally have much less romantic ideas about animals. In Britain <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">hunting</span> foxes with dogs arouses hostile feelings, especially among people living in towns, but the law to ban it, which came into effect in 2005, is seen by many people living in the country as an attack on their way of life. There is also a lot of discussion about whether the numbers of <span class="ndv">badgers</span>, which are a type of wild animal living in the countryside, should be reduced. They are thought to pass on the disease <span class="ndv">tuberculosis</span> to cows, and therefore many farmers are in favour of a reduction in their numbers. Other people feel that it is wrong to kill badgers and that other solutions to the problem should be found.</span><span class="p">In Britain and the US many people are concerned about <span class="eb">animal rights</span>, especially the use of animals in scientific research and public pressure has forced many cosmetics manufacturers to stop testing products on animals. Several groups, including the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Animal Liberation Front</span></span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">PETA</span>, strongly oppose <span class="eb">vivisection</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the use of live animals in experiments<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="eb">animal rights activists</span> organize protests at laboratories where animals are used. Sometimes people who work or invest in companies that own the laboratories are threatened.</span><span class="p">Concern about farming methods in which animals are fattened as quickly as possible in artificial conditions causes many people to become vegetarians or to buy only meat that is from animals that have lived in good conditions.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def">mid 19th cent.</span>: abbreviation of <span class="xr"><span class="xh">zoological garden</span></span>, originally applied specifically to that of Regent's Park, London.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">These lions were born in the zoo.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We saw a baby polar bear at the zoo.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a badly-run zoo</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
