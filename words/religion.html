class="ndv" type="deadxref">Roman Catholic</span> church, followed by the Southern Baptist Convention. There are many different Christian churches in the US and the majority of religious Americans are <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Protestant</span> Christians. 76% of Americans describe themselves as Christian. 15% say that they have no religion. Although there is no established <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> official<span class="wrap">)</span></span> religion in the US, religion plays an important part in public life and churches are centres of social events and business activities as well as places of worship. The <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Pledge of Allegiance</span> includes the phrase ‘one nation under God’ and the official US motto is ‘In God We Trust’. Since the 1960s some Americans have tried to stop government support of religion. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Establishment Clause</span></span> in the Constitution forbids the establishment of a state religion. In 1963 the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Supreme Court</span> decided it was ‘unconstitutional’ for students to pray or read the Bible in class but many schools ignore this ruling. What is taught about evolution in schools is a subject of much legal debate with some religious people objecting to the teaching of evolution as scientific fact and other Americans arguing that creationism <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the belief that the universe was made by God exactly as described in the Bible<span class="wrap">)</span></span> is religion and should not be taught in schools .</span><span class="p">The largest Protestant group in the US are the Baptists. Other groups include <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Methodists</span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Lutherans</span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Presbyterians</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Episcopalians</span>, who are part of the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Anglican</span> communion. The Pentecostal Church is a charismatic church, where emotions are freely expressed and spiritual healing is practised. Other Christian religious groups include the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Jehovah's Witnesses</span>, the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Christian Scientists</span>, the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Mormons</span> and the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Seventh-Day Adventists</span>. There are groups who have a special way of life apart from the modern world such as the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Shakers</span>, the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Amish</span>, the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Mennonites</span> and the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Hutterites</span>. There are many <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">evangelical</span> churches in the US and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">evangelists</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">televangelists</span> include Billy Graham, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell.</span><span class="p">Judaism is the second largest religious group in the US. Most American Jews are from families which came to the US from Central and Eastern Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries. Other large religious groups in the US include Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Culture"><span class="unbox"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Culture</span><span class="body"><span class="h1">religion in Britain</span><span class="p">In the Census of 2001, British people were asked for the first time to answer a question about their religion, although they were not forced to answer the question. This question was repeated in the Census of 2011. Then 75% replied that they had a religion (2001: 85%) and 59% of them said that they were Christian (2001: 71%). 4.8% said they were Muslim (2001:3%). Other religions, including Hindus, Sikhs, Jews and Buddhists made up a further 4% together. 7.2% of people did not answer the question. Although the majority of the population describe themselves as Christian, only a very small proportion go to church regularly. British people rarely discuss religion and feel that a person's religious beliefs are a private matter.</span><span class="p">The established <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> official<span class="wrap">)</span></span> church in England is the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Church of England</span>. Members of the Church describe themselves informally as ‘C of E’. In Scotland the official church is the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Presbyterian</span> Church of Scotland, known by Scots as ‘the Kirk’. There is no established church in Wales and Northern Ireland. In Wales the Anglican Church is known as the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Church in Wales</span></span>. The Church is involved in political life as <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">archbishops</span>and some <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">bishops</span> are members of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">House of Lords</span> and are chosen by the Queen or King following the advice of the Prime Minister. The monarch must be a member of the Church of England and is its official head. Christian religious education is provided in state schools but children do not have to take part. About 10% of the population are <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Roman Catholic</span> and there are also Catholic schools.</span><span class="p">Protestant groups other than the Church of England are called Free or <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Nonconformist</span> Churches. The Free Churches include the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">United Reformed Church</span></span>, the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Baptist</span> church and the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Methodist</span> church. Nonconformist churches are also sometimes called chapels.</span><span class="p">Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus in Britain are mainly from families who came to Britain after <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">World War II</span> from <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">India</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Pakistan</span>, although there has been a Muslim community in Britain since the 16th century. The history of Jews in Britain goes back to Roman times but many Jews in Britain today are from families who came to Britain as refugees from other countries in Europe at various times in the 19th and 20th centuries. Synagogues, mosques, Hindu temples and gurdwaras <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> Sikh places of worship<span class="wrap">)</span></span> are found in cities and many towns. The first British mosque was established in Cardiff in 1860 and the first gurdwara in London in 1911. The Hindu temple at Neasden in London is the largest in Europe. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Chief Rabbi</span></span> is the main representative of British Jews and there are many religious organizations that represent particular religious groups. The Muslim Council of Britain and the Hindu Forum are among the largest of these.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Middle English</span></span> (originally in the sense <span class="qt">‘life under monastic vows’</span>): from <span class="lang">Old French</span>, or from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">religio(n-)</span> ‘obligation, bond, reverence’, perhaps based on <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">religare</span> ‘to bind’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Almost all religions offer the idea of sacred space.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">As a result of her brother’s death, Maria found religion.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Darwinism contradicted orthodox religion.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Do you still practise your religion?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Eastern religions such as Shintoism</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Football has become an alternative religion for many people.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He believes that all religions originated from a single source.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He founded a new religion.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He reportedly embraced religion and became a vegetarian.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I believe in God, but I don’t belong to any organized religion.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I believe we should respect all religions of the world equally.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I don’t think the government should try to impose religion on our society.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">In their religion, mountains are sacred.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Islam is one of the great world religions.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She believed that her religion needed to be defended by philosophy and logic.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She has no religion.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The law prohibits the government form endorsing a particular religion.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The majority of children adopt the religion of their parents.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The teachers started preaching the Christian religion to us at every opportunity.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">These faiths draw on the traditional religions of indigenous peoples.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">These people are predominantly Russian Orthodox by religion.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">They never discussed religion or politics.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">This popular religion is a blend of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism with spirit beliefs.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We’re waiting for the company to get religion on recycling.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a religion based on reason</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> <span class="idm-gs"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Idioms</span> <span class="idm-g"> <div class="top-container"> <div class="top-g"> <span class="idm">get religion</span> <div class="clear"> &nbsp; </div> <br> </div> </div><span class="sn-gs"><span class="sn-g"><span class="label-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="reg">informal</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="reg">disapproving</span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">to suddenly start believing in a <span class="dh">religion</span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
