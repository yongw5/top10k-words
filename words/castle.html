When built, they were solid buildings with few comforts, designed for the defence of a town or region. About 1 200 castles were built in the 11th and 12th centuries, but the grandest were built in <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Edward I's</span></span> reign (1272–1307) . These include the castles of <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Caernarfon</span>, Conwy and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Harlech</span>, all in Wales, which were built by Edward after he defeated the Welsh leader Llewelyn ap Gruffydd. Many Scottish castles were built between the 13th and 17th centuries. They were <span class="eb">tower houses</span>, square buildings five or six floors high with small towers on top.</span><span class="p">Few castles are now lived in. Some are museums and contain valuable old furniture and weapons; others are <span class="ndv">ruins</span>. Many are open to the public and are popular tourist attractions.</span><span class="p">The site for a castle was very important. It needed to be on top of a hill or steep cliff, and to have a reliable source of water. The earliest <span class="eb">fortifications</span>, dating from the 9th century, consisted of earthen <span class="eb">ramparts</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> high banks of soil<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and a <span class="eb">stockade</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> wooden fence<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">In the 11th century, the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Normans</span> built <span class="eb">motte and bailey</span> castles. On top of a <span class="eb">motte</span>, a steep bank of earth, they built a wooden tower surrounded by a <span class="eb">palisade</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> fence<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Around this was a <span class="eb">bailey</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> courtyard<span class="wrap">)</span></span> which was surrounded by another palisade and a <span class="ndv">ditch</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a long, narrow channel dug in the ground<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Later, wooden towers were replaced with stone towers, called <span class="eb">keeps</span>. The tower contained accommodation for people living in the castle, a <span class="eb">great hall</span> where they ate meals, and often a <span class="eb">dungeon</span>, a room under the ground where prisoners could be kept. The Great Tower at the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Tower of London</span></span>, begun in 1078, is one of the earliest stone keeps.</span><span class="p">In the 13th century, wooden fences were replaced by long, high <span class="eb">curtain walls</span> made of stone, with <span class="eb">battlements</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a wall with gaps in it at intervals<span class="wrap">)</span></span> along the top. Walls might be 10 feet/3 metres thick. Towers often projected outwards at the base so that people attacking could easily be seen from above.</span><span class="p">Many castles had a strong <span class="eb">gatehouse</span> or a <span class="eb">moat</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a deep, wide channel of water<span class="wrap">)</span></span> which was crossed by a <span class="eb">drawbridge</span> that was raised and lowered by chains operated from inside the gatehouse. There was also a thick door and a <span class="eb">portcullis</span>, heavy metal <span class="ndv">grating</span> that slid down to block the entrance.</span><span class="p">The main method of attacking a castle was to fill the moat with stones and to attack the walls with <span class="eb">battering rams</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> heavy wooden beams<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Stones and balls of fire were thrown into the castle by <span class="eb">siege engines</span>. Attackers also dug tunnels under the walls. Defenders shot arrows from the battlements or through <span class="eb">slit windows</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> very narrow openings<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, or poured hot oil onto the attackers. In later times <span class="eb">cannon</span> were used. If the castle was strong and could not be captured, the attackers would <span class="eb">besiege</span> it <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> remain camped outside to prevent anyone entering or leaving<span class="wrap">)</span></span> until the defenders had no more food and were forced to surrender.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#6424154e1ad64468aa342ae5f10fc16d" class="sen"></a> <div class="ox-enlarge"> <a class="topic no-href" otitle=""><img src="/media/english/fullsize/g/gam/games/games_boardgames.jpg" style="display:none;" onclick="this.style.display='none';this.nextSibling.style.display='block';"><img class="thumb" src="/media/english/thumb/g/gam/games/games_boardgames.jpg" otitle="" onclick="this.style.display='none';this.previousSibling.style.display='block';"></a> </div><span class="num">2</span> <span class="v-gs" type="vf"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">also</span> <span class="v-g"><span class="v"><strong>rook</strong></span></span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="dis-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="dtxt">in <span class="ndv">chess</span></span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">any of the four pieces placed in the corner squares of the board at the start of the game, usually made to look like a <span class="dh">castle</span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">late Old English</span></span>: from <span class="lang">Anglo-Norman French</span> and <span class="lang">Old Northern French</span> <span class="ff">castel</span>, from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">castellum</span>, diminutive of <span class="ff">castrum</span> ‘fort’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Edinburgh castle was loyally held in the queen’s name.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The castle overlooks the town.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The castle perches on a high rock.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The castle was held by an opposing faction.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">They had to approach the castle through thick swamps.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The intruder was arrested in the grounds of Windsor Castle.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The ruins of an ancient castle stand to the west of the town.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> <span class="idm-gs"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Idioms</span> <span class="idm-g"> <div class="top-container"> <div class="top-g"> <span class="idm">(build) castles in the air</span> <div class="clear"> &nbsp; </div> <br> </div> </div><span class="sn-gs"><span class="sn-g"><span class="def">(to have) plans or dreams that are not likely to happen or come true</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">As a child he would wander round the boatyards, building castles in the air about owning a boat one day.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> <span class="idm-g"> <div class="top-container"> <div class="top-g"> <span class="idm">a man’s home is his castle</span> <span class="label-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="geo" geo="usa">US English</span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="v-gs" type="vf"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="v-g"><span class="label-g"><span class="geo" geo="br">British English</span></span> <span class="v"><strong>an Englishman’s home is his castle</strong></span></span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <div class="clear"> &nbsp; </div> <br> </div> </div><span class="sn-gs"><span class="sn-g"><span class="label-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="reg">saying</span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">a person’s home is a place where they can be private and safe and do as they like</span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
