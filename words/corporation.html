A <span class="eb">statutory company</span> is set up by an <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Act of Parliament</span></span>. Many former statutory companies that were managed by the government, such as those responsible for Britain's railway system and coal industry, have now been privatized <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> sold and made into privately run companies operating for profit<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">Most commercial businesses in Britain are <span class="eb">registered companies</span>. Lists of these are kept by the Registrar of Companies, and company information and accounts are kept at <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Companies House</span></span>. Registered companies may be either <span class="eb">private companies</span> or <span class="eb">public companies</span>. Private companies have a limited number of <span class="eb">shareholders</span> (or <span class="eb">members</span>), and their shares are not available to the general public. Shares in public companies can be bought and sold by the public on the <span class="ndv">stock exchange</span>.</span><span class="p">A <span class="eb">limited company</span>, sometimes called a <span class="eb">limited liability company</span>, can be either private or public. The liability <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> responsibility<span class="wrap">)</span></span> of shareholders for any losses is limited to the value of their shares. Private limited companies have the letters <span class="eb">Ltd</span> after their name. A <span class="eb">public limited company</span> (<span class="eb">plc</span>) must offer its shares for sale to the public. Most large companies in Britain, such as <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">BP</span>, for example, are public limited companies. A special type of limited company, the <span class="eb">company limited by guarantee</span>, is used especially for charities. Rather than buy shares, its members promise to pay for a share of debts if it fails.</span><span class="p">Most businesses in the US are <span class="eb">corporations</span>, which are similar to British limited companies. People who invest money in them are liable for <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> risk losing<span class="wrap">)</span></span> only the amount they have invested. Some corporations sell their shares on the stock exchange, but others do not. Small corporations, e.g. family businesses, may be called <span class="eb">close corporations</span>. Corporations often have the letters <span class="eb">Inc.</span> (short for ‘incorporated’) after their name. The laws about how corporations are formed and should operate vary from state to state.</span><span class="p">In both Britain and the US, professional businesses like law firms are often <span class="eb">partnerships</span>, which consist of two or more people who own a business and are together responsible for its debts. In a <span class="eb">limited partnership</span> ‘general partners’ run the business and take responsibility for debts while ‘limited partners’ only invest money.</span><span class="p">A <span class="eb">sole proprietorship</span> is run by one person only. Many small businesses in the US operate in this way because the rules are much simpler than those for corporations. Sole proprietorships do not have limited liability. If the name of the business is not the same as the name of the person who runs it, the letters <span class="eb">d.b.a.</span> are used, short for <span class="eb">doing business as</span>, e.g. Ted Smith, d.b.a. Ted's Book Store.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#6c4126ffc1a949daa5ac85ae50b7c542" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2</span><span class="def">an organization or a group of organizations that is recognized by law as a single unit</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">urban development corporations</span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#6c4126ffc1a949daa5ac85ae50b7c542" class="sen"></a><span class="num">3</span><span class="label-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="geo" geo="br">British English</span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">a group of people elected to govern a large town or city and provide public services</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the Lord Mayor and Corporation of the City of London</span></span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">late Middle English</span></span>: from <span class="lang">late Latin</span> <span class="ff">corporatio(n-)</span>, from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">corporare</span> ‘combine in one body’, from <span class="ff">corpus</span>, <span class="ff">corpor-</span> ‘body’.</span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
