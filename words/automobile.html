Almost everybody over the age of 15 is a driver and most households have a vehicle. American life is arranged so that people can do most things from their cars. There are <span class="eb">drive-in</span> banks, post offices, restaurants, movie theatres and even some churches.</span><span class="p">In Britain the proportion of the population who are drivers is slightly less but, as in the US, many people prefer to use their car rather than public transport, because it is more convenient and because they like to be independent. In order to reduce <span class="ndv">pollution</span> the government tries to discourage car ownership by making driving expensive. In particular, it puts a heavy tax on fuel and increases the annual <span class="eb">road tax</span> for cars that cause heavy pollution. <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Congestion charging</span> is used to persuade people to avoid driving their cars in city centres.</span><span class="p">To many people the make and quality of their car reflects their status in society, and it is important to them to get a smart new car every few years. In Britain since 2001 the <span class="eb">registration number</span> of a car shows the place and date of registration but older <span class="eb">number plates</span> can be used and a <span class="eb">personalized number plate</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a registration number that spells out the owner's name or initials<span class="wrap">)</span></span> may also suggest status. Many people prefer to buy a small, <span class="ndv">economical</span> car, or get a <span class="ndv">second-hand</span> one. Cars in the US are often larger than those in Britain and though fuel is cheaper, insurance is expensive. In the US car <span class="eb">license plates</span>, commonly called <span class="eb">tags</span>, are given by the states. New ones must be bought every two or three years, or when a driver moves to another state. The states use the plates to advertise themselves: <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Alabama</span> plates say ‘The heart of Dixie’ and have a small heart on them, and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Illinois</span> has ‘The land of Lincoln’.</span><span class="p">In Britain, before a person can get a <span class="eb">driving licence</span> they must pass an official <span class="eb">driving test</span>, which includes a written test of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Highway Code</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the rules that all road users must obey<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and a practical driving exam. Only people aged 17 or over are allowed to drive. <span class="eb">Learner drivers</span> who have a <span class="eb">provisional driving licence</span> must display an <span class="eb">L-plate</span>, a large red ‘L’, on their car, and be <span class="ndv">supervised</span> by a qualified driver. The US has no national <span class="eb">driver's license</span> (<span class="ei">AmE</span>), but instead licences are issued by each state. Most require written tests, an eye test and a short practical test. The minimum age for getting a licence is normally 16, although some states will issue a <span class="eb">learner's permit</span> to drivers as young as 14. Many states now apply a system of <span class="eb">graduated licenses</span> in which young drivers are first required to have an <span class="eb">intermediate license</span> for a period of time before being given a <span class="eb">full license</span>. An intermediate licence may, for example, prevent driving alone at particular times of the day or require the driver to take special classes if they drive badly. Americans have to get a new driver's license if they move to another state.</span><span class="p">In Britain people drive on the left and in the US they drive on the right. Generally British and US drivers are relatively careful and <span class="ndv">courteous</span> but there is dangerous driving. In the US many of the deaths due to <span class="eb">traffic accidents</span> are caused by drivers who have drunk alcohol. <span class="eb">Drink-driving</span> (<span class="ei">AmE</span> <span class="eb">driving under the influence</span> or <span class="eb">driving while intoxicated</span>) <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> driving a car after drinking alcohol<span class="wrap">)</span></span> is also a serious problem in Britain. On many British roads <span class="eb">speed cameras</span> have been set up to catch drivers who go too fast. In the US the main job of state <span class="eb">highway patrols</span> is to prevent <span class="eb">speeding</span>.</span><span class="p">Many drivers belong to a motoring organization in case their car breaks down. In Britain the main ones are the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">AA</span> (Automobile Association) and the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">RAC</span> (Royal Automobile Club), and in the US the largest is the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">American Automobile Association</span>.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def">late 19th cent.</span>: from <span class="lang">French</span>, from <span class="ff">auto-</span> ‘self’ + <span class="ff">mobile</span> ‘mobile’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Compressed natural gas can be used to power automobiles.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Learning to drive an automobile is not easy.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">automobile exports</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the influence of the automobile on American society</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
