In the 18th and 19th centuries wealthy people travelled and collected plants, animal skins, historical objects and works of art. They kept their collection at home until it got too big or until they died, and then it was given to a museum. The 80 000 objects collected by Sir Hans Sloane, for example, formed the core collection of the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">British Museum</span></span> which opened in 1759.</span><span class="p">The parts of a museum open to the public are called <span class="eb">galleries</span> or <span class="eb">rooms</span>. Often, only a small proportion of a museum's collection is on display. Most of it is stored away or used for research. A person in charge of a department of a museum is called a <span class="eb">keeper</span>. Museum staff involved in the care and conservation of items are sometimes called <span class="eb">curators</span>.</span><span class="p">Many museums are lively places and they attract a lot of visitors. As well as looking at <span class="eb">exhibits</span>, visitors can play with computer <span class="ndv">simulations</span> and imagine themselves living at a different time in history or walking through a <span class="ndv">rainforest</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a thick, wet tropical forest<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. At the Jorvik Centre in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">York</span>, the city's <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Viking</span> <span class="ndv">settlement</span> is <span class="ndv">recreated</span>, and people experience the sights, sounds and smells of the old town. Historical <span class="ndv">accuracy</span> is important but so also is entertainment. Museums must compete for people's leisure time and money with other amusements. Most museums also welcome school groups and arrange special activities for children.</span><span class="p">In Britain, the largest museums are the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">British Museum</span></span>, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Science Museum</span></span>, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Natural History Museum</span></span> and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Victoria and Albert Museum</span></span>. Museums outside London also cover every subject and period. Homes of famous people sometimes become museums, such as the house where <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Shakespeare</span> was born in <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Stratford-upon-Avon</span></span>.</span><span class="p">The first public museum in the US was the Charlestown Museum in South Carolina, founded in 1773. The largest is the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Smithsonian Institution</span></span> in Washington, DC, a group of 14 museums. The most popular of these is the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">National Air and Space Museum</span></span>. Some US museums are art museums. Many describe a period of history. In <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Gettysburg</span>, Pennsylvania, for example, a museum explains the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Civil War</span> and gives details of <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">the Battle of Gettysburg</span></span>. <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Halls of Fame</span> are museums that honour people who have been outstanding in a certain field, e.g. baseball or rock music.</span><span class="p">National museums receive money from the government but not enough to cover their costs. Museums usually have a shop selling books, <span class="ndv">postcards</span> and gifts, and often a cafe. Their profits help to fund the museum. Some museums have the support of a commercial <span class="ndv">sponsor</span>. In small museums only a few people have paid jobs, and the rest are <span class="ndv">volunteers</span>, called <span class="eb">docents</span> in the US, who lead tours and answer visitors' questions.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Culture"><span class="unbox"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Culture</span><span class="body"><span class="h1">art galleries and museums of art</span><span class="p">In Britain, works of art are displayed in art galleries and, especially outside London, in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">museums</span>. Shops that sell paintings are also called galleries. In the US public <span class="eb">art collections</span> are displayed in <span class="eb">art museums</span>, and a <span class="eb">gallery</span> is a place where people go to buy works of art.</span><span class="p">Many galleries and museums in Britain and the US receive limited financial support from national or local government. Other money is raised through <span class="ndv">admission fees</span>, although admission to many British museums is free, and the sale of <span class="ndv">postcards</span>, <span class="ndv">calendars</span> and other gifts. Some galleries obtain money through <span class="ndv">sponsorship</span>. Many works of art are expensive and galleries can rarely buy them without organizing a public appeal or, in Britain, asking for money from<span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">the Art Fund</span></span>.</span><span class="p">Visiting an art gallery is a popular leisure activity. Galleries and museums are friendlier places than they used to be. Many try to encourage children's interest in art by arranging school visits and many people make their first trip to an art museum with their school class.</span><span class="p">The most popular galleries in Britain, all in London, are the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">National Gallery</span></span>, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">National Portrait Gallery</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Tate Britain</span></span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Tate Modern</span></span>. The <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Royal Academy's</span> Summer Exhibition of paintings sent in by the general public also receives a lot of visitors. Sculpture attracts less attention, and though the names of <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Henry Moore</span></span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Barbara Hepworth</span></span> are known to many people, few could describe any of their works. Well-known galleries outside London include the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">National Gallery of Scotland</span></span> in Edinburgh and the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.</span><span class="p">Important art museums in the US include the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Metropolitan Museum of Art</span></span>, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Museum of Modern Art</span></span> and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Guggenheim Museum</span></span>, all in New York, and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Smithsonian Institution</span></span> in Washington, DC. Most US cities and many smaller towns have art museums.</span><span class="p">Galleries sometimes <span class="eb">mount exhibitions</span> of the paintings or art works of one artist, that are brought together from all over the world. People are prepared to queue for a long time to see them. Many people admire <span class="eb">old masters</span>, famous works by great artists of the past, but have little interest in modern art. New works receive publicity in the media only when they are unusual or likely to shock people. Galleries and museums try to encourage a more positive attitude to modern art but many people remain doubtful. There is usually controversy about the winners of the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Turner Prize</span></span></span><span class="p">Some exhibitions bring together all kinds of art, not only paintings, from a particular time or country so that people can learn about it. Exhibitions on subjects such as the Aztecs, <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">art nouveau</span> or the art of Turkey attract large crowds.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def">early 17th cent.</span> (denoting a university building, specifically one erected at Alexandria by Ptolemy Soter): via <span class="lang">Latin</span> from <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="ff">mouseion</span> ‘seat of the Muses’, based on <span class="ff">mousa</span> ‘muse’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">All the planes are museum pieces.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Although the mill is no longer in commercial use, it is maintained as a working museum.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He founded a museum of modern art in his home town.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Los Angeles County Museum of Art</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The first painting acquired by the museum was by Hopper.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The museum houses a fine collection of textiles.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The museum is housed in a converted church.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The website’s print gallery is a virtual museum.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">There’s a gift shop in the museum.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a museum devoted to children’s toys</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a museum devoted to railway memorabilia</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">an exhibition of Chinese ceramics at the Ashmolean Museum</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">an open-air museum of farming and the countryside</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">one of the world’s great museums</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the Museum of Modern Art</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
