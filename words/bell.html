In Britain the sound of church bells from a <span class="eb">belfry</span> is associated with Sunday mornings and with weddings. Bells throughout the country may also be rung at times of national celebration. Before minor services or to announce a <span class="ndv">funeral</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a service for a dead person<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, a single bell is usually sounded repeatedly for five or ten minutes. The blessing of the bread and wine at a Communion service may also be indicated by the sounding of a bell.</span><span class="p">Churches usually have between 5 and 12 bells, which are rung by teams of <span class="eb">bell-ringers</span>. The ringers stand far below the bells and each pulls on a long rope attached to a bell in such a way that the bell swings over in a circle, causing the <span class="eb">clapper</span> inside the bell to strike the side. In a <span class="eb">peal</span> each of the bells is rung in turn, and the order in which they are rung changes according to a pattern. This is called <span class="eb">change-ringing</span>. Complicated tunes can be played and many <span class="eb">changes</span> have their own name, e.g. <span class="ebi">Grandsire Triples</span> and <span class="ebi">Oxford Treble Bob</span>.</span><span class="p">Other types of institution also use bells: Great Tom, the big bell at Christ Church College, Oxford, is rung 101 times each night, indicating the original number of <span class="ndv">scholars</span> at the college. The most famous bell in Britain is <span class="ndv">Big Ben</span>, the large bell in the clock tower next to the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Houses of Parliament</span> in London, which <span class="eb">chimes</span> the hours and is heard on radio and television.</span><span class="p">Bell-ringing used to be a popular hobby though it is now sometimes necessary to use a recording of bells before church services because of a <span class="ndv">shortage</span> of bell-ringers. Some people complain about the noise of bells but most people like the sound.</span><span class="p">America's experience with bells did not begin well, since the nation's <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Liberty Bell</span></span> cracked in 1752. Bells are heard in churches and at colleges and universities. Some communities, especially in <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">New England</span>, ring bells as a celebration. Bells are also used to announce the time, mostly using the eight notes of Big Ben.</span><span class="p">There are very few traditional bell-ringers in the US. Instead, many institutions have <span class="eb">carillon bells</span>, a group of up to 70 bells controlled from a keyboard like that of an organ. Carillon bells can play tunes and simple harmonies. The 50 bells of the Allen &amp; Perkins Carillon at Duke University in <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">North Carolina</span></span> were first used to play songs in 1932. Other well-known carillons include the Sather Tower Carillon at the University of California at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Berkeley</span>. Many of the bells in the US are imported from Britain.</span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a href="entry://#32ffd0d3004d4f18ba355c7080e08bf0" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2 </span><span class="sym_first"> <a class="oxford3000 no-href">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="def">an electrical device which makes a ringing sound when a button on it is pushed; the sound that it makes, used as a signal or a warning</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x"><span class="cl"><strong>Ring the bell</strong></span> to see if they're in.</span></span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">The <span class="cl"><strong>bell's ringing</strong></span>!</span></span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">The bell went for the end of the lesson.</span></span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">An <span class="cl"><strong>alarm bell</strong></span> went off.</span></span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="label-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="reg">figurative</span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x"><span class="cl"><strong>Warning bells</strong></span> started ringing in her head as she sensed that something was wrong.</span></span></span></span> </li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="More Like This"><span class="unbox"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">More Like This</span><span class="body"> <span class="h1">Similes in idioms</span> <span class="inline"><span class="li">as bald as a coot</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as blind as a bat</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as bright as a button</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as bold as brass</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as busy as a bee</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as clean as a whistle</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as dead as a dodo</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as deaf as a post</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as dull as ditchwater</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as fit as a fiddle</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as flat as a pancake</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as good as gold</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as mad as a hatter</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as miserable/​ugly as sin</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as old as the hills</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as pleased as Punch</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as pretty as a picture</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as regular as clockwork</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as quick as a flash</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as safe as houses</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as sound as a bell</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as steady as a rock</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as thick as two short planks</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="li">as tough as old boots</span></span><span class="p"><span class="xr-gs" type="pdf"><span class="xr-g">See worksheet.</span></span></span> </span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Old English</span></span> <span class="etym_i">belle</span>, of <span class="lang">Germanic</span> origin; related to <span class="lang">Dutch</span> <span class="ff">bel</span>.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Saved by the bell!
