Each country within the United Kingdom has a national emblem, as well as its own flag. England's official emblem is a <span class="eb">red rose</span>. Red and white roses were chosen as emblems during the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Wars of the Roses</span></span>. Afterwards, the two were combined in the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Tudor rose</span></span>. Other emblems include a <span class="eb">bulldog</span>, often wearing a Union Jack <span class="ndv">waistcoat</span>, and <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">John Bull</span>, an old-fashioned, fat country gentleman. Wales has two plants, the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">leek</span> and the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">daffodil</span>, and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Welsh dragon</span></span> as its emblems, and also uses the figure of a Welsh woman dressed in traditional costume. Welsh people often wear a daffodil on <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">St David's</span></span> Day. Scotland has the <span class="eb">thistle</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a prickly weed<span class="wrap">)</span></span> as its official emblem, but a <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">tartan</span> pattern is used on many products made in Scotland. The national symbol of Northern Ireland is the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Red Hand of Ulster</span></span>, which appears on its flag. The <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">shamrock</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">harp</span> are also associated with Ireland and the shamrock is the emblem of the Republic of Ireland.</span><span class="p">Members of the British <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">royal family</span></span> and the <span class="ndv">aristocracy</span> have <span class="eb">coats of arms</span>. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">royal arms</span></span> are placed behind judges and <span class="ndv">magistrates</span> in law courts as a symbol of authority. Below the arms is the <span class="eb">motto</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> phrase with special meaning<span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="ei">Dieu et mon droit</span>, French for ‘God and my right’. Some commercial organizations whose products have royal approval are granted special permission to show the royal arms on their products.</span><span class="p">The best-known emblem of the British government is the <span class="eb">portcullis</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a barred, chained gate<span class="wrap">)</span></span> that appears on official government papers. The <span class="eb">Great Seal of the United States</span>, which appears on US money and government documents, shows a <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">bald eagle</span>, a very large bird which is itself a symbol of the US, and the Latin motto <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">e pluribus unum</span></span> which refers to the fact that the US is one country made up from many individual states.</span><span class="p">Each US state has a variety of emblems, including animals and plants which are commonly found in that state. For example, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Michigan</span> has a state bird (the robin), a state fish (the <span class="ndv">trout</span>), a state flower (the apple <span class="ndv">blossom</span>), a state insect (the dragonfly) and a state stone (the <span class="ndv">Petoskey</span> stone). These symbols may appear on the state flag and on official documents.</span><span class="p">Most commercial organizations, <span class="ndv">charities</span>, <span class="ndv">political parties</span>, sports clubs, etc. have an emblem that they put on flags, <span class="ndv">notepaper</span>, badges and vehicles, sometimes together with their initials. These emblems are often so well known that there is no need for the organization's name to be added. They may involve a picture that suggests the name, e.g. a picture of an apple for <span class="eb">Apple™</span> computers, or the name written in a particular way. Such commercial emblems can be very valuable and may be registered as <span class="eb">trademarks</span>, to prevent anyone else using them.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def">1930s</span>: abbreviation of <span class="xr"><span class="xh">logogram</span></span> or <span class="etym_i">logotype</span>.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">His jacket sports the logo of the Giants.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She wore the logo of the sponsoring company.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The company has a distinctive logo that makes it well known.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The diary features the organization’s distinctive new logo.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The new logo was unveiled in a blaze of publicity.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a red shirt with the team logo on it</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the logo for the World Cup</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the logo of the New York Police Department</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
