Traditionally, women change their surname when they marry, replacing their <span class="eb">maiden name</span>, the surname they had from birth, with the surname of their husband. In the US especially, some women keep their maiden name as a middle name. Others choose to keep their maiden name as their surname after they are married. A few create a <span class="eb">double-barrelled</span> name (<span class="ei">AmE</span> <span class="eb">hyphenated name</span>) from the two surnames, such as Johnson-Brown. In a few cases the husband and children may also take this name. In Britain a double-barrelled surname used to suggest an upper-class background, but this is no longer always so.</span><span class="p">In the US, laws about changing a last name, whether after marriage or for some other reason, vary from state to state, but it is usually a simple process and in some states people can just begin to use a new name if they want to. In Britain a woman can change her surname automatically after marriage. If people wish to change their name for any other reason they can do so by <span class="eb">deed poll</span>, a simple legal procedure.</span><span class="p">In fact people rarely change their surname except after marriage, and many people are able to research their family history over many centuries. Most families were known by surnames by 1300 and many of the old names are still common. Sometimes the names reflected the place where the family lived, such as the name of their village or a reference to a feature of the local countryside, e.g. <span class="ei">Ford</span>, <span class="ei">Hill</span> or <span class="ei">Wood</span>. Other surnames refer to the original occupation or <span class="ndv">trade</span> of the family, e.g. <span class="ei">Baker</span>, <span class="ei">Miller</span>, <span class="ei">Shepherd</span> and <span class="ei">Smith</span>. Sometimes the surname began as a <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">nickname</span>. For instance, someone with dark hair or dark skin might be called <span class="ei">Black</span>, <span class="ei">Blake</span> or <span class="ei">Brown</span>. Some surnames were taken from personal names, as in <span class="ei">Andrews</span>, <span class="ei">Martin</span> and <span class="ei">Roberts</span>. Others were based on French names that came to Britain during the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Norman Conquest</span></span>, e.g. <span class="ei">Sinclair</span> from the French ‘Saint-Clair’.</span><span class="p">Many surnames occur throughout Britain, but others suggest a particular regional origin. Many Scottish names begin with <span class="ei">Mc-</span> or <span class="ei">Mac-</span>, meaning ‚son of‘, e.g. <span class="ei">McDonald</span> and <span class="ei">MacGregor</span>. Members of a <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">clan</span> added this prefix to their father's name. Irish surnames often begin with <span class="ei">O'</span>, meaning ‚descended from‘, e.g. <span class="ei">O'Brien</span>. Many Irish surnames are derived from ancient <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Celtic</span> names. Common Welsh surnames include <span class="ei">Evans</span>, <span class="ei">Morgan</span>, <span class="ei">Price</span>, <span class="ei">Rees</span> and <span class="ei">Williams</span>. The most common surname in England and Scotland is <span class="ei">Smith</span>, closely followed by <span class="ei">Jones</span>, a name also widely found in Wales. Other surnames were brought to Britain by families from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and China. These include <span class="ei">Ahmed</span>, <span class="ei">Hussain</span>, <span class="ei">Khan</span>, <span class="ei">Patel</span>, <span class="ei">Singh</span> and <span class="ei">Tsang</span>.</span><span class="p">All the surnames found in Britain are also found in the US, together with many others from all over the world. Some people wanted to sound more American when they arrived in the US and so took English last names. Sometimes government <span class="ndv">officials</span> could not understand the names of new arrivals and wrote similar English names on their documents. Many Americans of German origin changed their names during the two world wars. <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">African Americans</span> whose ancestors were slaves do not know what last names their families originally had. Many have English or Irish names, because slaves had to take the names of their owners.</span><span class="p">When British and American people introduce themselves they give their <span class="eb">first name</span> and then their surname, e.g. Michael Johnson, Linda Johnson. The opposite order 'Johnson, Michael‘ is used only in alphabetical lists. In informal situations people often give only their first name. When people are addressed formally a title is put before their last name, usually <span class="eb">Mr</span> for men and <span class="eb">Mrs</span>, <span class="eb">Miss</span> or <span class="eb">Ms</span> for women. Married women used always to be called Mrs Johnson, etc. Unmarried women were known as Miss Johnson, etc. Many women now prefer the title <span class="ei">Ms</span> because, like <span class="ei">Mr</span>, it does not give any information about whether the person is married. Other titles include <span class="eb">Dr</span> for medical doctors and people with a doctorate <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the highest university degree<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="eb">General</span>, <span class="eb">Colonel</span>, etc. for people holding military ranks. People can be addressed as Dr Jones, Professor Roberts etc. or simply as Doctor (for a medical doctor) and Professor. Men especially may be referred to simply by their last name, e.g. <span class="ei">the previous president was Clinton</span>, but addressing somebody in this way can seem old-fashioned or may cause offence.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Middle English</span></span>: partial translation of <span class="lang">Anglo-Norman French</span> <span class="ff">surnoun</span>, suggested by <span class="lang">medieval Latin</span> <span class="ff">supernomen</span>.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">On marriage most women still take their husband’s surname.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Rossi is a common surname in Italy.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The teacher addresses the students by their surnames.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">On marriage most women in this country still take their husband’s surname.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
