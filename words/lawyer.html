When making decisions Scottish courts look for an appropriate general principle and apply it to a particular situation. English law relies on <span class="eb">case law</span>, a collection of previous decisions, called <span class="eb">precedents</span>. English courts look at precedents for the <span class="eb">case</span> being tried and make a similar judgement. A basic principle of law in Britain is that anyone accused is <span class="eb">innocent until proven guilty</span>, so it is the job of the <span class="eb">prosecution</span> to <span class="eb">prove beyond reasonable doubt</span> that the <span class="eb">defendant</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the person accused<span class="wrap">)</span></span> has broken the law as stated in the <span class="eb">charge</span>. If this cannot be proved the person must be <span class="eb">acquitted</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> allowed to go free, with no blame attached<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">British law is divided into <span class="eb">civil law</span> which concerns disagreements between individuals about matters such as business contracts, and <span class="eb">criminal law</span> which deals with offences that involve harm to a person resulting from somebody <span class="eb">breaking the law</span>. In civil cases, the <span class="eb">plaintiff</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the person who claims to have been wronged<span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="eb">brings an action</span> against the <span class="eb">defendant</span> in the hope of winning <span class="eb">damages</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a financial payment<span class="wrap">)</span></span> or an <span class="eb">injunction</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a court order preventing the defendant from doing something<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Criminal cases are brought against criminals by the state, in England and Wales by the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Director of Public Prosecutions</span> and in Scotland through <span class="eb">procurators fiscal</span>.</span><span class="p">In England and Wales most towns have a <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Magistrates' Court</span></span> where minor cases are judged and more serious cases are passed to higher courts by three magistrates called <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Justices of the Peace</span>, specially trained members of the public. The more serious cases are heard in a <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Crown Court</span> by a <span class="eb">judge</span> and a <span class="eb">jury</span>. Minor civil cases, such as divorce and <span class="ndv">bankruptcy</span>, are heard in the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">county courts</span> and more serious ones in the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">High Court of Justice</span>. <span class="ndv">Appeals</span> against decisions from the Crown Court or the High Court go to the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Court of Appeal</span></span> and a few cases, where a question of law is in doubt, are passed to the <span class="eb">Supreme Court</span>, which has replaced the House of the Lords as the highest court in the country.</span><span class="p">In Scotland, criminal cases are heard in <span class="eb">District Courts</span> by members of the public called <span class="eb">lay justices</span>. More serious cases go to regional <span class="eb">sheriff courts</span> and are heard by the <span class="ndv">sheriff</span> and a <span class="ndv">jury</span>. <span class="ndv">Appeals</span> go to the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">High Court of Justiciary</span></span> in Edinburgh. Civil cases begin in the sheriff court and may go on appeal to the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Court of Session</span>.</span><span class="p">In the US, the <span class="eb">judicial</span> system is one of the three branches of the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">federal government</span></span>, but the legal system operates at many levels with state, county and city courts as well as <span class="ndv">federal</span> courts. The right to <span class="eb">trial by jury</span> is provided by the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Constitution</span>. Each type of court has its own <span class="eb">jurisdiction</span>, that is it deals with certain kinds of cases. Both civil and criminal cases are first heard in <span class="eb">trial courts</span> and there is a right to <span class="ndv">appeal</span> against the court's decision in a <span class="eb">court of appeals</span>. Many states have <span class="eb">family courts</span> where people get divorced and <span class="eb">small claims courts</span> which deal with small amounts of money. States also have trial courts, which hear a wider range of cases, and courts of appeal called <span class="eb">superior courts</span> or <span class="eb">district courts</span>. Most states have a <span class="eb">supreme court</span> where the most serious <span class="ndv">appeals</span> are held. States have their own <span class="eb">criminal code</span>, but some crimes are <span class="eb">federal offences</span>, i.e. against federal law, and crimes may fall under <span class="eb">federal jurisdiction</span> if more than one state is involved.</span><span class="p">Most courts have only one <span class="eb">judge</span>, but some higher courts have several. In the US Supreme Court, the nine judges are called <span class="eb">justices</span>. The people on either side of a case are represented by <span class="eb">lawyers</span>, also called <span class="eb">attorneys-at-law</span>. In a criminal trial the defendant is represented by a <span class="eb">defense attorney</span>, or if he or she is too poor to pay a lawyer, the court will appoint a <span class="eb">public defender</span>. The <span class="eb">prosecution</span> is led by an <span class="eb">assistant district attorney</span> or, in federal cases, by a <span class="eb">federal attorney</span>.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">A leading human rights lawyer took on his case.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He brought in a hot-shot criminal defense lawyer who secured a not guilty verdict.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He was a trial lawyer for many years.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a top criminal defence lawyer</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Corporate lawyers managed to delay the case coming to court.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He was among the leading international lawyers of his generation.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Lawyers for the families said they were pleased with the decision.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She has built a reputation as a top criminal lawyer.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">You would be wise to consult a lawyer.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">You’ll be hearing from my lawyer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
