People often go to the pub nearest their home, known as their <span class="ndv">local</span>. Pubs have their own character and atmosphere. Some attract young people by playing loud music, others have large television screens so that people can watch sport and there are also traditional village pubs which are often very old and are the centre of village life. Most pubs have more than one <span class="ndv">bar</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a room to drink in<span class="wrap">)</span></span> where drinks are sold from a counter, also called a <span class="ndv">bar</span>. Often people in a group will take it in turns to go to the bar to buy a <span class="ndv">round</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a drink for each person in the group<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. The most popular drinks are <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">beer</span> and lager. <span class="ndv">Tied houses</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> pubs owned by breweries<span class="wrap">)</span></span> sell beers made by the company and <span class="ndv">guest beers</span> from other breweries, and <span class="ndv">free houses</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> pubs not owned by a brewery<span class="wrap">)</span></span> offer beers made by several different companies, often including <span class="ndv">real ales</span> made using traditional methods. Pubs usually sell <span class="ndv">crisps</span> and nuts and many do simple <span class="ndv">pub meals</span> such as sausage and chips or a <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">ploughman's lunch</span>. Others, sometimes called <span class="ndv">gastropubs</span>, sell a wider range of food and are like restaurants. Under Britain's <span class="ndv">licensing laws</span> alcohol can only be sold to people over 18, and children under 14 are not allowed in pubs unless there is a <span class="ndv">family room</span>, a room without a bar, or an outside area called a <span class="ndv">beer garden</span>. Before 1998 pubs were only allowed to open at <span class="ndv">lunchtime</span> and in the evening, but since then <span class="ndv">opening hours</span> have become more flexible so that pubs can open all day and even for 24 hours if they have a licence to do so. When <span class="ndv">closing time</span> approaches, the <span class="ndv">barman</span> or <span class="ndv">barmaid</span> rings a bell and calls out ‘Last orders!’, to give customers time to order one more drink. After the bar person has called ‘Time!’ customers are allowed ten minutes <span class="ndv">drinking-up time</span> to finish their drinks and leave. Pubs always have a name which is shown on a brightly painted sign hanging outside with a picture on it. Many names are hundreds of years old and may have their roots in <span class="ndv">legends</span>, such as the <span class="ebi">Green Man</span>, some are named after kings and queens or historical figures, and others refer to things in country life, such as the <span class="ebi">The Plough</span> or <span class="ebi">The Bull</span>.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def">mid 19th cent.</span>: abbreviation of <span class="xr"><span class="xh">public house</span></span>.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He spent all afternoon in the pub.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I had to sing in crowded, smoky pubs.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">It’s one of those modern theme pubs.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Let’s go down the pub for a drink.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The corner pub is quite good.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the atmosphere of a cosy country pub</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He’s gone down the pub for a pint.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He’s the landlord of the local pub.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We stopped on the way for a pub lunch.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">to go on a pub crawl.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
