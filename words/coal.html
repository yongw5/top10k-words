It was used as fuel in the factories built during the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Industrial Revolution</span> and continued to be important until the 1980s. The main <span class="eb">coalfields</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> areas where coal is mined<span class="wrap">)</span></span> were in north-east England, the north Midlands and the valleys of South Wales, especially the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Rhondda Valley</span></span>. Towns and villages grew around the <span class="eb">collieries</span> or <span class="eb">pits</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> coal mines<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and were dominated by the <span class="eb">pithead</span> where the lifting machinery was, and by large black <span class="eb">slag heaps</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> piles of waste material<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Poor conditions and low pay led to a long history of industrial trouble and caused miners to play a leading role in the development of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">trade union</span> movement.</span><span class="p">In 1913 Britain produced 292 million tons of coal and employed over a million miners. In 1947, when the mines were nationalized <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> brought under government control<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, there were still about 1 000 collieries and 700 000 miners. Increased use of <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">North Sea oil</span></span> and gas in the 1970s led to a lower demand for coal. Coal gas was replaced by natural gas. By the mid 1980s there were only 160 collieries and 200 000 miners. Fear of further job losses led to the long and violent <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">miners' strike</span></span> of 1984–5. In the 1990s there were more <span class="eb">pit closures</span>. In mining communities throughout Britain thousands of former miners have struggled to find new jobs. Collieries were returned to private ownership in 1994, and most coal now produced in Britain is sold to the <span class="ndv">electricity-generating</span> industry. By 2003 no more than 11 000 people were employed in mining, and this number has grown smaller since then.</span><span class="p">Coal mining is important in the US, with the US producing a large part of the world's coal. Most is mined in the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Appalachian Mountains</span></span>. Modern mining techniques used in <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">West Virginia</span></span> have removed whole mountain tops and destroyed large areas of forest. Coal is used especially in the <span class="ndv">electricity-generating</span> industry and in the manufacture of steel.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Old English</span></span> <span class="etym_i">col</span> (in the senses <span class="qt">‘glowing ember’</span> and <span class="qt">‘charred remnant’</span>), of <span class="lang">Germanic</span> origin; related to <span class="lang">Dutch</span> <span class="ff">kool</span> and <span class="lang">German</span> <span class="ff">Kohle</span>.
