excitement and <span class="ndv">glamour</span> of the <span class="eb">film industry</span>. The world's major film companies have studios in Hollywood and many famous <span class="eb">film/​movie stars</span> live in its fashionable and expensive <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Beverly Hills</span></span> district. But Hollywood is also <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Tinseltown</span>, where money can buy an expensive lifestyle but the pressure to succeed can ruin lives, as in the case of <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Marilyn Monroe</span></span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">River Phoenix</span></span>. Both the British and Americans have mixed feelings about Hollywood: they are attracted by the excitement of the film world and by the lives of the stars, but also see Hollywood as a symbol of <span class="ndv">trashy</span>, commercial culture.</span><span class="p">Hollywood is now surrounded by <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Los Angeles</span></span>. In 1908, when film companies began moving west from New York, it was a small, unknown community. The companies were attracted to <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">California</span> by its fine weather, which allowed them to film outside for most of the year, but they also wanted to avoid having to pay money to a group of studios led by <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Thomas Edison</span></span> which were trying to establish a <span class="ndv">monopoly</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the exclusive right to make films<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Most of the companies were run by people from Jewish families who had come to America from Europe. By the 1920s, companies such as <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Universal Pictures</span></span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">United Artists</span></span> had set up studios around Hollywood. During this period <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Mary Pickford</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Douglas Fairbanks</span></span>, and John <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Barrymore</span> became famous in <span class="eb">silent films</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> films without sound<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Mack Sennett</span></span>, a Canadian, began making comedy films, including those featuring the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Keystone Kops</span></span>, in which <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Charlie Chaplin</span></span> and 'Fatty' <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">'Fatty' Arbuckle</span></span> became stars. <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">D W Griffith</span></span> directed expensive 'epic' films like <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">The Birth of a Nation</span></span>, and William S Hart made <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">westerns</span> popular. Hollywood also created its first sex symbol, Theda Bara (1890-1955) .</span><span class="p">The 1920s saw big changes. The first film in Technicolor was produced in 1922. <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Warner Brothers</span></span> was formed in 1923 and four years later produced Hollywood's first <span class="eb">talkie</span><span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> film with spoken words<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">The Jazz Singer</span></span>. Huge numbers of Americans were now attracted to the <span class="eb">movies</span>. Stars like Pickford and Chaplin reached the height of their fame, and new stars were discovered, such as <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Rudolph Valentino</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Laurel and Hardy</span></span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Buster Keaton</span></span>.</span><span class="p">The 1930s and 1940s were Hollywood's 'Golden Age' and films became popular around the world. Hollywood even made successes out of America's worst times: <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Prohibition</span> led to the gangster films of <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Edward G Robinson</span></span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">James Cagney</span></span>, and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Great Depression</span></span> to films like <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">The Grapes of Wrath</span></span>. <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">World War II</span> featured in successful films like <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Casablanca</span>. The great Hollywood studios, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">MGM</span>, Warner Brothers, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">20th Century Fox</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Paramount Pictures</span></span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Columbia Pictures</span></span>, controlled the careers of actors. Famous directors of the time included <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Orson Welles</span></span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">John Ford</span></span> and screen stars included <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Clark Gable</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">John Wayne</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Katharine Hepburn</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Errol Flynn</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Henry Fonda</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Humphrey Bogart</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Lauren Bacall</span></span>,<span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Bette Davis</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Gregory Peck</span></span>, Kirk Douglas and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Robert Mitchum</span></span>.</span><span class="p">New words were invented to keep up with Hollywood's development: <span class="ei">cliffhanger</span>, <span class="ei">tear jerker</span>, <span class="ei">spine-chiller</span> and <span class="ei">western</span> describe types of film. Villains became <span class="ei">baddies</span> or <span class="ei">bad guys</span>. As equipment became more <span class="ndv">sophisticated</span> more people were needed to manage it. New jobs, still seen on lists of film credits today, included <span class="ei">gaffer</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> chief electrician<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="ei">best boy</span>, his or her chief assistant.</span><span class="p">In the 1950s large numbers of people abandoned the movies in order to watch television. The film industry needed something new to attract them back. This led to the development of <span class="eb">Cinerama</span> and <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">3-D</span>, which gave the audience the feeling of being part of the action. These proved too expensive but the wide screen of <span class="eb">CinemaScope</span> soon became standard throughout the world. 3-D has become popular again in the 21st century. The stars of the 1950s, including <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Marilyn Monroe</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Rock Hudson</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">James Dean</span></span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Steve McQueen</span></span>, also kept the film industry alive.</span><span class="p">In the 1960s many companies began making films in other countries where costs were lower, and people said Hollywood would never again be the centre of the film industry. But the skills, equipment and money were still there, and Hollywood became important again in the 1980s. The old studios were bought by new <span class="ndv">media</span> companies: 20th Century Fox was bought by Rupert Murdoch, and Columbia by the Sony Corporation. New energy came from independent directors and producers like Steven Spielberg, Robert Redford and Martin Scorsese. Rising stars included Meryl Streep, Harrison Ford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Costner and Tom Hanks.</span><span class="p">Now, more than ever, Hollywood leads the world's film industry, having produced the most expensive and successful films ever made, such as <span class="ebi">Jurassic Park</span> (1993), <span class="ebi">Independence Day</span> (1996) and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Titanic</span> (1997). Companies like MGM own their own <span class="eb">movie theaters</span> in the US and elsewhere. Studios make extra profits from selling films to television companies and from selling videos and DVDs. <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">The Oscars</span>, presented by Hollywood's <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</span></span>, are the most valued prizes in the industry.</span></span></span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Her father played all the old home movies.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I’d never go to a movie alone.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Johnson really steals this movie as Cassius.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Liz paused the movie and walked over to the phone.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The former footballer is now mixing with movie people in Hollywood.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The movie contains a lengthy car chase through the streets of Paris.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The movie follows their lives on a small Arkansas farm.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The movie is set in a New England school.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The movie opens with a quote from the Buddha.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We watched a home movie of my second birthday party.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We’re having a movie night with pizza and beer.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a movie about the life of Castro</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a movie based on the novel by Betty Munn</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a movie entitled ‘Short Legs’</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">an excellent actor who could easily carry the movie all on his own</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the movie rights to her autobiography</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the movie version of the well-known novel</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Have you seen the latest Tarantino movie?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a famous movie director/​star</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
