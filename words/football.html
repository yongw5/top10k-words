It is played by boys in most schools. Most towns have an <span class="ndv">amateur</span> football team <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a team which does not get paid for playing<span class="wrap">)</span></span> which plays in a <span class="eb">minor league</span>. Football is also the most popular <span class="eb">spectator sport</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> sport that is watched<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in Britain. Many people go to see their favourite professional team playing <span class="eb">at home</span>, and some go to <span class="eb">away matches</span>. Many more people watch football on television.</span><span class="p">The rules of football are relatively simple: two teams of 11 players try to get a round ball into the opposing team's <span class="eb">goal</span> and to prevent their opponents from scoring. The ball may be kicked or <span class="eb">headed</span>, but never <span class="ndv">handled</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> touched with the hand<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, except by the <span class="eb">goalkeepers</span>. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Football Association</span></span> was founded in 1863 to decide the rules of football and the resulting game became known formally as <span class="eb">association football</span>. It is sometimes also called <span class="eb">soccer</span>. Many of today's leading <span class="eb">clubs</span> were established shortly afterwards.</span><span class="p">Most professional clubs represent large cities, or parts of London. They include <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Everton</span>, Liverpool, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Manchester United</span></span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Arsenal</span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Chelsea</span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Tottenham Hotspur</span></span>. The most famous Scottish clubs include <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Rangers</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Celtic</span>. In 1992 football was reorganized so that the best 20 teams in England and Wales play in the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Premier League</span></span>, while 70 other teams play in three <span class="eb">divisions</span>, run by the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Football League</span></span>. There is a <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Scottish Professional Football League</span></span> with four divisions, formed in 2013 when the Scottish Football League joined with the Scottish Premier League. At the end of each season, the top few teams in each division are <span class="eb">promoted</span> and the bottom teams are <span class="eb">relegated</span>. As well as the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Premier League</span></span>, the main competitions in England and Wales are the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">FA Cup</span></span> and the <span class="eb">League Cup</span>. A few of the most successful sides have won <span class="eb">the Double</span>, the Premier League and the FA cup in the same year. The biggest clubs are now run as major businesses, and top players earn large salaries. They are frequently <span class="eb">transferred</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> bought and sold<span class="wrap">)</span></span> between clubs for millions of pounds. Many foreign stars also now play for British teams, and in many top clubs British players are in the minority.</span><span class="p">England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all have their own national sides. England won the World Cup in 1966, when its stars included Bobby Charlton, Bobby Moore and Geoff Hurst.</span><span class="p">An increase in <span class="eb">football hooliganism</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> violence and damage to property by supporters<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in the 1970s and 1980s frightened many people away from football matches. English fans got a bad reputation in Europe and football violence became known as ‘the English disease’. Disasters such as that at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Hillsborough</span>, in which many people died, also discouraged people from going to matches. Formerly, football grounds had <span class="eb">terraces</span>, where supporters stood packed close together, and <span class="eb">stands</span> containing rows of seats which were more expensive. These grounds have now almost all been replaced by <span class="eb">all-seater stadiums</span>, but people complain about the rising cost of tickets. Many clubs have their own <span class="eb">fanzine</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a magazine about the club written and published by the fans<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Some supporters also buy a copy of their team's <span class="eb">strip</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> shorts and shirt in team colours<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">This type of football is known in the US as soccer to distinguish it from the American game. Enthusiasm increased after 1994 when the World Cup was played for the first time in the US. In 1999 the US won the Women's World Cup. In 1996 <span class="eb">Major League Soccer</span> (<span class="eb">MLS</span>) was established, and teams compete for the <span class="eb">MLS Cup</span>. Students in colleges and universities also play soccer in three <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">NCAA</span> divisions. The nation's oldest <span class="ndv">tournament</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> series of games that leads to one winner<span class="wrap">)</span></span> is the US Open Cup.

In Britain and elsewhere the game is often called <span class="eb">American football</span> to distinguish it from <span class="ndv">soccer</span>. American football developed from the games of football and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Rugby</span>. There is a lot of dangerous play, so <span class="eb">helmets</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> hard round hats<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and thick <span class="eb">pads</span> must be worn. Each game has <span class="eb">cheerleaders</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> people that lead shouts of support for a team<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and bands of musicians that march on the field between the <span class="eb">halves</span> of the game. Whole families go to watch games, and there is almost no violence from supporters. Many games are shown live on US television. British television now also shows some games. In US <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">high schools</span>, colleges and universities, football games are the centre of many social events, such as <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">homecoming</span>.</span><span class="p">The game is played by two teams of 11 players each, with different players used for <span class="eb">defense</span>, <span class="eb">offense</span> and <span class="eb">kicks</span>. The field is 100 yards/91.5 metres long and 53 yards 1 foot/49 metres wide. It is sometimes called a <span class="eb">gridiron</span> because the lines across it that mark every 10 yards/9 metres make it look like the metal tray on which meat is <span class="ndv">grilled</span> or <span class="ndv">broiled</span>. At each end of the field there is an extra 10 yards/9 metres, called the <span class="eb">end zone</span>, with a <span class="eb">goal post</span> in the shaped of an ‘H’. The ball is oval-shaped and sometimes called a <span class="eb">pigskin</span> because the balls were formerly made from the skin of pigs.</span><span class="p">A team scores when its players send the ball down the field and across the opponent's <span class="eb">goal line</span> for a <span class="eb">touchdown</span> of six points. They can then add a <span class="eb">point after touchdown</span> (<span class="eb">PAT</span>) if they kick the ball through the goal posts. A team can get three points if the ball is kicked between the goal posts without a <span class="ndv">touchdown</span>, and two points if their defense stops the opponents in their own end zone.</span><span class="p">The team with the ball must move it 10 yards/9 metres in four <span class="eb">downs</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> separate actions<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. This is done from behind <span class="eb">linemen</span> who face the defense's linemen. An action begins when the <span class="eb">quarterback</span> takes the ball from between the legs of the <span class="eb">center</span> and runs with it, hands it to another runner or <span class="eb">passes</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> throws<span class="wrap">)</span></span> it to another player. Between actions, the team with the ball has a <span class="eb">huddle</span> so the quarterback can tell them what to do next. If 10 yards/9 metres are not made in 4 downs, the team can <span class="eb">punt</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> kick the ball to the other team<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. The defense can also get the ball by an <span class="eb">interception</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a catch of the opponent's pass<span class="wrap">)</span></span> or a <span class="eb">fumble</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a ball accidentally dropped<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">The <span class="eb">National Football League</span> (<span class="eb">NFL</span>) has 32 professional teams. Teams from the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">American Football Conference</span></span> and from the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">National Football Conference</span></span> play against each other to decide the two that will meet in the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Super Bowl</span>. Some well-known teams include the Dallas Cowboys, the Denver Broncos, the Green Bay Packers, the Pittsburgh Steelers and San Francisco 49ers.</span><span class="p">The best college teams play in <span class="eb">bowl games</span>, e.g. the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Rose Bowl</span></span>, Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl and Cotton Bowl. The best college players are chosen as <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">All-Americans</span>. Famous professional players almost always play in college teams first.
