<span class="eb">local</span> newspaper every day. Some have it delivered to their home by a <span class="eb">paper boy</span> or <span class="eb">paper girl</span>; others buy it from a <span class="eb">newsagent</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a shop that sells newspapers, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">magazines</span>, sweets, etc.<span class="wrap">)</span></span> or a <span class="eb">bookstall</span>. Many people read a newspaper <span class="eb">online</span> and the number doing this is increasing very fast. Some newspapers charge for their online edition. National <span class="eb">dailies</span> are published each morning except Sunday. Competition between them is fierce. Local daily papers, which are written for people in a particular city or region, are sometimes published in the morning but more often in the early evening.</span><span class="p">The US has only one national newspaper, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">USA Today</span></span>. The rest are local. A few newspapers from large cities, such as the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">New York Times</span></span> and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Washington Post</span></span>, are read all over the country. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">International New York Times</span></span>formerly the<span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">International Herald Tribune</span></span> is published outside the US and is read by Americans abroad. Many Americans <span class="eb">subscribe</span> to a newspaper which is delivered to their house. This costs less than buying it in a shop. Papers can also be bought in bookshops and supermarkets and most newspapers have online versions.</span><span class="p">In Britain the newspaper industry is still sometimes called <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Fleet Street</span>, the name of the street in central London where many newspapers used to have their offices. Britain has two kinds of national newspaper: the <span class="eb">quality papers</span> and the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">tabloids</span>, now sometimes called the <span class="eb">red tops</span>. The qualities were also called the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">broadsheets</span> because they were printed on large pages, but are now often in tabloid size which is half the size of a broadsheet. They report national and international news and are serious in tone. They have <span class="eb">editorials</span> which comment on important issues and reflect the political views of the paper's <span class="eb">editor</span>. They also contain financial and sports news, <span class="eb">features</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> articles<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, <span class="eb">obituaries</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> life histories of famous people who have just died<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, <span class="eb">listings</span>, <span class="eb">crosswords</span>, <span class="eb">cartoons and comic strips</span>, <span class="eb">advertisements</span>and the weather forecast.</span><span class="p">The tabloids report news in less depth. They concentrate on <span class="eb">human-interest stories</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> stories about people<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, and often discuss the personal lives of famous people. People who disapprove of the tabloids call them <span class="eb">the gutter press</span>. The most popular are <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">The Sun</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">The Mirror</span></span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">The Express</span></span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">The Daily Mail</span></span>. <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">The News of the World</span></span>, a Sunday tabloid, at one time sold more copies than any other newspaper in Britain, but it was closed down in 2011, after it had been accused of <span class="eb">phone hacking</span>.</span><span class="p">There are also local papers, many of which are <span class="eb">weeklies</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> published once a week<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. They contain news of local events and sport, carry advertisements for local businesses, and give details of houses, cars and other items for sale. Some are paid for by the advertisements they contain and are delivered free to people's homes. Some cities also have a daily paper published in the evening, for example, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">the Evening Standard</span></span> in London.</span><span class="p">A daily newspaper from a medium-sized US city has between 50 and 75 pages, divided into different sections. The most important stories are printed on the front page, which usually has the beginnings of four or five articles, and colour photographs. The articles continue inside. The rest of the first section contains news stories, an <span class="eb">opinion page</span> with editorials, and <span class="eb">letters to the editor</span>, written by people who read the paper. Another section contains local news. The sport section is near the end of the paper, with the features section. This contains comics and also <span class="eb">advice columns</span>, such as <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Dear Abby</span></span>. There are advertisements throughout the paper.</span><span class="p">Tabloids contain articles about famous people but do not report the news. They are displayed in supermarkets, and many people read them while they are waiting to pay.</span><span class="p">On Sundays newspapers are thicker. There are usually fewer news stories but more articles analysing the news of the past week and many more features, including a colour section of comics.</span><span class="p">Newspapers get material from several sources. <span class="eb">Staff reporters</span> write about national or local news. Major newspapers also have their own <span class="eb">foreign correspondents</span> throughout the world. Others get foreign news from <span class="eb">press agencies</span> or <span class="eb">wire services</span>, such as <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Associated Press</span> or <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Reuters</span>. Some papers have their own <span class="eb">features writers</span>. In the US features are usually <span class="eb">syndicated</span>, which means that one newspaper in each area can buy the right to print them. The editor decides what stories to include each day but the <span class="eb">publisher</span> or owner has control over general policy. Newspaper owners are very powerful and are sometimes called <span class="eb">press barons</span>. The most famous of these is Rupert Murdoch.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Do you take a daily newspaper?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Have you got a copy of yesterday’s newspaper?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He launched a weekly newspaper called ‘The Challenge’.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Her article appeared in the Saturday newspaper.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Savage, writing in an Auckland newspaper, quotes an eminent academic.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She got a job on a national newspaper.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She sued the newspaper for publishing photos of her on the beach.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The company is a strong contender in the race for the Scottish newspaper group.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The newspaper carried advertisements for several products.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The newspaper comes out every Saturday.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The newspapers speculated that the star was about to propose to his girlfriend.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Which newspaper do you buy?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">an article in a local newspaper</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">newspapers owned by the Tribune Company</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">today’s edition of the newspaper</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I read about it in the newspaper.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She works for the local newspaper.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">There has always been concern about newspaper proprietors owning television stations.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
