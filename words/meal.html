names vary according to people's <span class="ndv">lifestyles</span> and where they live.</span><span class="p">The first meal of the day is <span class="eb">breakfast</span>. The traditional <span class="eb">full English breakfast</span> served in many British hotels may include fruit juice, <span class="ndv">cereal</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a food made from processed grains and eaten with milk<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, bacon and eggs, often with sausages and tomatoes, <span class="ndv">toast</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> slices of bread cooked until they turn brown<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="ndv">marmalade</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> jam made with oranges and similar fruit<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, and tea or coffee. Few people have time to prepare a cooked breakfast at home and most have only cereal and/​or toast with tea or coffee. Others buy coffee and a <span class="ndv">pastry</span> on their way to work.</span><span class="p">The traditional <span class="eb">American breakfast</span> includes eggs, some kind of meat and toast. Eggs may be fried, ‘over easy’, ‘over hard’ or ‘sunny side up’, or boiled, <span class="ndv">poached</span> or in an <span class="ndv">omelette</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> beaten together and fried<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. The meat may be bacon or sausage. People who do not have time for a large meal have toast or cereal and coffee. It is common for Americans to eat breakfast in a restaurant. On Saturday and Sunday many people eat <span class="eb">brunch</span> late in the morning. This consists of both breakfast and lunch dishes, including <span class="ndv">pancakes</span> and <span class="ndv">waffles</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> types of cooked batter<span class="wrap">)</span></span> that are eaten with butter and <span class="ndv">maple syrup</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a sweet, sticky sauce produced from a type of <span class="ndv">maple</span> tree<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Lunch</span>, which is eaten any time after midday, is the main meal of the day for some British people, though people out at work may have only <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">sandwich</span>es. Some people also refer to the midday meal as <span class="eb">dinner</span>. Most workers are allowed about an hour off work for it, called the <span class="eb">lunch hour</span>, and many also go shopping. Many schools offer a cooked lunch (<span class="eb">school lunch</span> or <span class="eb">school dinner</span>), though some students take a <span class="eb">packed lunch</span> of sandwiches, fruit, etc. <span class="eb">Sunday lunch</span> is special and is, for many families, the biggest meal of the week, consisting traditionally of roast meat and vegetables and a sweet course. In the US lunch is usually a quick meal, eaten around midday. Many workers have a half-hour break for lunch, and buy a sandwich from near their place of work. Business people may sometimes eat a larger lunch and use the time to discuss business.</span><span class="p">The main meal of the day for most people is the evening meal, called <span class="eb">supper</span>, <span class="eb">tea</span> or <span class="eb">dinner</span>. It is usually a cooked meal with meat or fish or a salad, followed by a sweet course. In Britain younger children may have tea when they get home from school. <span class="ei">Tea</span>, meaning a main meal for adults, is the word used in some parts of Britain especially when the evening meal is eaten early. <span class="ei">Dinner</span> sounds more formal than <span class="ei">supper</span>, and guests generally receive invitations to ‘dinner’ rather than to ‘supper’. In the US the evening meal is called <span class="ei">dinner</span> and is usually eaten around 6 or 6.30 p.m. In many families, both in Britain and in the US, family members eat at different times and rarely sit down at the table together.</span><span class="p">Many people also eat <span class="eb">snacks</span> between meals. Most have tea or coffee at mid-morning, often called <span class="eb">coffee time</span> or the <span class="eb">coffee break</span>. In Britain in the past this was sometimes also called <span class="eb">elevenses</span>. In the afternoon many British people have a <span class="eb">tea break</span>. Some hotels serve <span class="eb">afternoon tea</span> which consists of tea or coffee and a choice of sandwiches and cakes. When on holiday/​vacation people sometimes have a <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">cream tea</span> of scones, jam and cream. In addition many people eat chocolate bars, biscuits (<span class="ei">AmE</span> cookies) or crisps (<span class="ebi">AmE</span> chips). Some British people have a snack, sometimes called supper, consisting of a milk drink and a biscuit before they go to bed. In the US children often have milk and cookies after school.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a href="entry://#71dbc11610914f63b454f95603991526" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2 </span><span class="sym_first"> <a class="oxford3000 no-href">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">countable</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">the food that is eaten at a <span class="dh">meal</span></span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">Enjoy your meal.</span></span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a three-course meal</span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#71dbc11610914f63b454f95603991526" class="sen"></a><span class="num">3</span> <span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">uncountable</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="use"><span class="wrap">(</span>often in compounds<span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">grain that has been crushed to produce a powder, used as food for animals and for making flour</span> </li> <span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">see also</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://bonemeal" otitle="bonemeal definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">bonemeal</span></span></a><span class="sep">,</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://oatmeal" otitle="oatmeal definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">oatmeal</span></span></a><span class="sep">,</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://wholemeal" otitle="wholemeal definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">wholemeal</span></span></a></span></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"><span class="hm-g"> <span class="pos">noun</span> <span class="sense">senses 1 to 2</span> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Old English</span></span> <span class="etym_i">mǣl</span> (also in the sense <span class="qt">‘measure’</span>, surviving in words such as <span class="etym_i">piecemeal</span> <span class="qt">‘measure taken at one time’</span>), of <span class="lang">Germanic</span> origin.
