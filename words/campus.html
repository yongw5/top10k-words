This is often not true. Many older people now study at college or university, sometimes on a <span class="ndv">part-time</span> basis while having a job and looking after a family. Many students are highly <span class="ndv">motivated</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> keen to do well<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and work very hard.</span><span class="p">In Britain reduced government support for higher education <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> education after A level<span class="wrap">)</span></span> means that students can no longer rely on having their expenses paid for them. Formerly, students received a <span class="eb">grant</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> regular payments of money<span class="wrap">)</span></span> towards their living expenses. Now most can only get a <span class="eb">loan</span>, which has to be paid back. From 1999 they have had to pay a fixed amount towards <span class="eb">tuition fees</span> and in 2011 a vote was passed in Parliament allowing universities to increase the amount up to a maximum of £9 000 per year. Scottish students studying at Scottish universities do not pay fees. In the US students already have to pay for <span class="eb">tuition</span> and <span class="eb">room and board</span>. Many get a <span class="eb">financial aid package</span> which may include <span class="ndv">grants</span>, <span class="ndv">scholarships</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> awards of money for study<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="ndv">loans</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> sums of money lent<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. The fear of having large debts places considerable pressure on students and many take <span class="ndv">part-time</span> jobs during the <span class="ndv">term</span> and work <span class="ndv">full-time</span> in the vacations.</span><span class="p">Many students in Britain go to a university away from their home town. They usually live in a <span class="eb">hall of residence</span> for their first year, and then move into a rented room in a private house or share a house with <span class="eb">housemates</span>. They may go back home during <span class="ndv">vacations</span>, but after they <span class="ndv">graduate</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> get a degree<span class="wrap">)</span></span> most leave home for good. In the US too, many students attend colleges some distance from where their parents live. They may live <span class="eb">on campus</span> in one of the halls, or <span class="eb">off campus</span> in apartments and houses which they share with <span class="eb">room-mates</span>. Some students, especially at larger universities, join a <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">fraternity</span> or <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">sorority</span>, a social group usually with its own house near the campus. Fraternities and sororities often have names which are combinations of two or three letters of the Greek alphabet. Some people do not have a good opinion of them because they think that students who are members spend too much time having parties.</span><span class="p">In Britain the interests of students are represented by a <span class="eb">student's union</span> which <span class="ndv">liaises</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> acts as a link<span class="wrap">)</span></span> with the university on academic matters, arranges social events and provides advice to students. Individual unions are <span class="ndv">affiliated</span> with <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> linked to<span class="wrap">)</span></span> the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">NUS</span>. The student union building is usually the centre of student life and has a bar and common room, and often a restaurant and shops. British universities have a wide range of societies, clubs and social activities including sports, <span class="ndv">drama</span> and politics. </span><span class="p">Especially in their first year, US students spend a lot of time on social activities. One of the most important celebrations, especially at universities which place a lot of emphasis on sports, is <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">homecoming</span>. Many <span class="eb">alumni</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> former students<span class="wrap">)</span></span> return to their <span class="eb">alma mater</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> college<span class="wrap">)</span></span> for a weekend in the autumn to watch a football game. During homecoming weekend there are also parties and dances, and usually a <span class="ndv">parade</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> procession<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">When social activities take up too much time, students <span class="eb">skip lectures</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> miss them<span class="wrap">)</span></span> or <span class="eb">cut class</span> (<span class="ei">AmE</span>) and <span class="eb">take incompletes</span> (<span class="ei">AmE</span>), which means they have to finish their work after the vacation. In the US this has the effect of lowering their course grades, but most US universities expect this behaviour from students and do little to stop it. Students are thought to be old enough to make their own decisions about how hard they work and to accept the consequences. A few students <span class="eb">drop out</span> (<span class="ei">AmE</span> <span class="eb">flunk out</span>) but the majority try hard to get good grades and a good degree.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def">late 18th cent.</span> (originally US): from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">campus</span> ‘field’, specifically applied to the <span class="n">Campus Martius</span> in Rome, used for games, athletic practice, and military drill.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She lives on campus.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Students at the Belfast campus have access to excellent sports facilities.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The Engineering department is on the main campus.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The number of Harvard graduate students living off campus has dropped.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The university has campuses in Cairns and Brisbane.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">They moved off campus to share a flat in the town.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
