They are involved with human rights, education, medical research and conservation of the environment. Many of them began in the time before governments provided any social services, when poor people had to turn to charitable organizations for help. Charities rely on money given by the public, and on help from volunteers in fund-raising and carrying out their activities. Many charities that are now well known throughout the world, such as <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Oxfam</span> and <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Amnesty International</span>, began in Britain. </span><span class="p">In Britain organizations qualify for <span class="eb">charitable status</span> if they are established for the 'public good'. Many charities ask well-known people, including members of the royal family, to become their <span class="eb">patrons</span>. Charities do not pay tax on the money they receive, but they are not allowed to make a profit.</span><span class="p">Charities in Britain are not allowed to take part in political activity, so some set up a separate <span class="ndv">pressure group</span> which campaigns on related issues. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Charity Commission</span></span> keeps a list of charities and advises them. The <span class="eb">Charities Aid Foundation</span> provides services to charities and helps people to <span class="ndv">donate</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> give<span class="wrap">)</span></span> to them. Well-known charities working in Britain include Oxfam, the British Heart Foundation, which pays for research into heart disease, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Barnardo's</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Shelter</span>.</span><span class="p">In the US religious organizations have traditionally received most money from the public, but their share has fallen recently. The next largest area is Education. Well-known charities include the Salvation Army, the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Red Cross</span>, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">United Negro College Fund</span></span>, which helps <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">African Americans</span> get an education, and the American Cancer Society. Local charities operate shelters for the homeless and soup kitchens where poor people can eat free.</span><span class="p">A lot of the work done by charities in the US, such as caring for the poor or providing education, is done in other countries by the government. Americans have a strong belief that, if possible, private groups, not the government, should do this work.</span><span class="p">A traditional method of raising money is to organize a <span class="eb">flag day</span>. Volunteers stand in busy streets asking members of the public to put money in a <span class="eb">collecting tin</span>. In exchange, they are given a paper sticker, formerly a small paper flag with a pin through it, with the charity's name on it. This is sometimes called 'tin-rattling'. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">British Legion's</span></span> flag day, called <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Poppy Day</span></span>, has become a feature of British life.</span><span class="p">Nearly every town in Britain has several <span class="eb">charity shops</span>. These are run by volunteer staff and sell second-hand clothes, books and household goods at low prices in aid of charity. Some shops, e.g. Oxfam shops, also sell goods made by people who are benefiting from the charity's work. At <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Christmas</span>, people often buy <span class="eb">charity cards</span>, cards sold in aid of charity. Charity shops (<span class="ei">AmE</span> <span class="eb">thrift shops</span>) are less common in the US, but include shops run by the Salvation Army and <span class="eb">Goodwill</span>.</span><span class="p">In recent years, the <span class="eb">telethon</span> has proved an effective method of fund-raising. During an evening of popular television programmes, television stars ask the public to telephone and <span class="eb">pledge</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> promise<span class="wrap">)</span></span> money to the charities involved. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Comic Relief</span></span> evening in Britain and the muscular dystrophy telethon in the US (the <span class="ei">MDA Show of Strength</span>) are famous. Other fund-raising activities include <span class="eb">fêtes</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> outdoor sales of craftwork, plants, etc.<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="eb">jumble sales</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> sales of second-hand goods<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Sponsored walks, cycle rides, even parachute jumps, where people agree to give money to a person completing a task, are also popular. At Christmas or <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Thanksgiving</span>, schools and churches organize collections of food, called <span class="eb">food drives</span> in the US, for old people and the poor.</span><span class="p">An important source of funds for charities in Britain is the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">National Lottery</span></span>, which gives a proportion of its income to 'good causes'.</span><span class="p">In both Britain and the US many workers have money taken from their pay and sent to charity. This is called <span class="eb">payroll giving</span>. Some companies in the US hold <span class="eb">fund-raising drives</span>, in which different parts of the company compete to see which of them <span class="eb">pledges</span> the most money. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">the United Way of America</span></span>, a national organization that collects money to give to small local charities, benefits from this. As in Britain, many people leave money to charity in their will. It is also common, when somebody dies, for the family to ask people to send a contribution to a charity instead of sending flowers to the funeral.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"
