A <span class="eb">pre-budget report</span> each autumn is given to introduce ideas on which the following year's budget will be based.</span><span class="p">On Budget Day the Chancellor explains in a long speech to the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">House of Commons</span> the financial policy of the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Treasury</span>, plans for government spending, and how the money for this will be raised through taxation. There is then a debate on the budget, which lasts for several days, followed by a vote to accept or reject it. The speech is broadcast on national radio and television and is much discussed by financial and political experts. Photographs of the Chancellor on Budget Day usually show him holding up the red leather case in which the speech is contained. The word <span class="ei">budget</span> originally meant a small leather bag.</span><span class="p">Many people fear budget changes, because they usually mean tax increases rather than reductions, particularly on alcohol, tobacco and fuel. Some of these increases become effective immediately and car drivers may rush to buy fuel just before the budget. Budgets announced close to general elections usually contain fewer tax increases to avoid making the government <span class="ndv">unpopular</span>.</span><span class="p">In the US the budget is a document describing how much money the government expects to have, and how it will use that money. <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Congress</span> spends a lot of time discussing how much money each part of the government needs. Each member of Congress tries to make sure that as much money as possible will be spent in the area he or she represents. This is called <span class="eb">pork-barrel politics</span>, and money spent to benefit a particular place is called <span class="eb">pork</span>. When Congress has decided on a budget the President considers it. In the past the President had to approve or <span class="ndv">veto</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> reject<span class="wrap">)</span></span> the whole budget, but now he has a <span class="eb">line-item veto</span> and can veto an individual item. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Office of Management and Budget</span></span> helps prepare the budget and checks how the money is spent.</span><span class="p">The US budget includes <span class="eb">revenues</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> sources of money<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="eb">spending</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> amounts that will be spent<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.
