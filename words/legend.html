They are the subject of several poems and stories of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Middle Ages</span> (11th-15th centuries), as well as of later novels, musical plays and films, and are a central part of British tradition and folklore. The most important <span class="eb">Arthurian</span> works include Sir <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Thomas Malory's</span></span> <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Le Morte D'Arthur</span></span>, a set of long prose romances <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> stories of love and adventure<span class="wrap">)</span></span> written in the 15th century, Alfred <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Lord Tennyson's</span></span> <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Idylls of the King</span></span>, a series of twelve poems dating from the 19th century and T H White's novel <span class="ebi">The Once and Future King</span> (1958) . The legends continue to be retold in new ways, for instance in the musical <span class="ebi">Camelot</span> (1960) and the films <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">The Sword in the Stone</span></span> and <span class="ebi">King Arthur</span> (2004) .</span><span class="p">The real King Arthur lived in the late 5th and early 6th century. He was a warrior chief who fought against the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Anglo-Saxons</span> and probably defeated them at the Battle of Badon. He is said to have died in the battle of Camlan. Stories about him were collected in the 12th century by the historian <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Geoffrey of Monmouth</span></span>. They were added to and developed by French writers such as Chrétien de Troyes, who wrote during the period 1170-90, and also became the centre of a group of legends in Germany. As a result, other characters such as <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Lancelot</span>, Tristram (Tristan) and Perceval (Parzival) became associated with Arthur and were included by Malory in <span class="ebi">Le Morte D'Arthur</span>, the version of the legends which became most widely known in Britain.</span><span class="p">The stories of Arthur and his knights celebrate the <span class="eb">age of chivalry</span>, when knights aimed to live according to the highest Christian principles. Their character and courage are tested by meetings with giants, dragons and sorcerers, and by their own human weakness, such as pride or forbidden love. The love affairs of Tristram and Isoud (Iseult) and Lancelot and Guinevere are part of the tradition of <span class="eb">courtly love</span> which was a central theme in European poetry of the Middle Ages.</span><span class="p">According to legend, Arthur was born at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Tintagel</span> in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Cornwall</span>, the son of Uther Pendragon, King of all England. One version says that at a young age he was put under a spell by the magician <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Merlin</span> so that he grew up not knowing he was heir to the English throne. He became King at the age of 15 after he pulled the magic sword <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Excalibur</span> out of a stone when all the knights of the kingdom had failed to do so. Another version of the legend says that he received the sword from the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Lady of the Lake</span></span>, and this fits in with the story that, as he was dying, he ordered the sword to be thrown back into the lake and it was caught by a hand that rose from the water. Arthur gathered round him the most worthy knights in the land, including Sir Lancelot, Lancelot's son Sir <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Galahad</span>, Sir Bedivere and Sir <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Gawain</span>, and established his court at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Camelot</span>. On Arthur's orders the knights all sat at the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Round Table</span></span>, so nobody could sit at the head of the table and claim to be more important than the rest.</span><span class="p">Arthur won many victories in battle and married the beautiful <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Guinevere</span>. Later, Arthur's half-sister, the sorceress Morgan le Fay, attempted to kill him, and Arthur's discovery of a love affair between his wife and Sir Lancelot further threatened his court. The knights went off in search of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Holy Grail</span>. Lancelot saw but failed to obtain it because he was not sufficiently pure, and it was eventually found by Sir Galahad. Arthur went to fight against Rome with Sir Gawain but while he was abroad, his nephew Mordred seized the kingdom and made Guinevere his prisoner. Arthur returned to England to defeat and kill Mordred at the battle of Camlan, but was himself seriously wounded. Morgan le Fay then appeared in a boat to take Arthur to <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Avalon</span>, the paradise of the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Celts</span>. According to some versions Arthur and his knights now lie asleep underground, waiting for the day they are needed to wake and save England from danger.</span><span class="p">Many people now visit Tintagel Castle high above the sea, the place where Arthur was born and later the home of Mark, the husband of Iseult, Tristram's lover. Several attempts have been made to identify where Arthur's Camelot was. Suggested sites include Caerleon in South Wales, Camelford and South Cadbury, both in Somerset, and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Winchester</span>. <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Glastonbury</span> is said to be Avalon because in the 12th century some monks there claimed to have found the graves of Arthur and Guinevere.</span></span></span></span> </li><li
