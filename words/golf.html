Most <span class="eb">golf courses</span> consist of 18 <span class="eb">holes</span>. To make play more difficult they are often <span class="ndv">hilly</span> and have various natural and man-made <span class="ndv">hazards</span> such as lakes, <span class="ndv">bunkers</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> pits filled with sand<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, and <span class="eb">rough</span>, long grass or trees on either side of the <span class="eb">fairway</span>.</span><span class="p">Each player has their own ball and several different types of <span class="eb">club</span> (<span class="eb">woods</span>, <span class="eb">irons</span> and a <span class="eb">putter</span>) with which to hit it. The club chosen depends on the type of shot the player needs to make. In professional <span class="ndv">tournaments</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> games<span class="wrap">)</span></span> players have a <span class="eb">caddie</span> to carry the bag of clubs from one hole to the next and to advise them on their play. Players try to finish each hole in a given number of shots, which is known as <span class="eb">par</span>. If they use one shot less than par they score a <span class="eb">birdie</span>; if they use two shots less they score an <span class="eb">eagle</span>; if they use three shots under par they score an <span class="eb">albatross</span>. If they manage to get the ball into the hole in a single shot they can claim a <span class="eb">hole in one</span>. If they use a shot more than par they score a <span class="eb">bogey</span>. A <span class="eb">handicap</span> is an advantage given to weaker players which is expressed as a number related to the number of shots above par. Professional golfers have a handicap of zero. At the end of a <span class="eb">round</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> all 18 holes<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, the player with the lowest score is the winner. Professional matches may consist of several rounds. The result sometimes depends on the total number of shots players have taken (<span class="eb">stroke play</span>), or else on the number of individual holes each player has won (<span class="eb">match play</span>).</span><span class="p">Golf began as a sport of the upper classes and in Britain in the past it attracted mainly people in business and the professions. Nowadays, it is played by a wide range of people of all classes, and many more golf courses have been built. The game can still be quite expensive to play and membership of the most popular <span class="eb">golf clubs</span> may cost a lot of money. The most famous British clubs include the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Royal and Ancient</span></span> at <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">St Andrews</span></span>, where the first official rules of golf were agreed in 1754, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Muirfield</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Wentworth</span>. Golf may have been taken to America by people from Scotland in the 17th century, but the first permanent club was not established there until 1888, in Yonkers, New York.</span><span class="p">There are four important international competitions for professional golfers, known as the <span class="eb">majors</span>, three of them held in the US. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Masters Tournament</span></span> is always held at Augusta, Georgia. The others are the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">US Open</span></span> and the <span class="eb">US PGA Championship</span>. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">British Open</span></span> is regarded as the world's top golf tournament. US and European teams also compete every two years in the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Ryder Cup</span></span>. The major US competitions for women include the <span class="eb">US Women's Open</span> and the <span class="eb">LPGA Women's Championship</span>. Amateur events include the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Walker Cup</span></span> and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Curtis Cup</span></span>. Television has helped to increase the popularity of the game.</span><span class="p">As well as golf courses, there are also many <span class="eb">driving ranges</span> where people can practise hitting golf balls over long distances, particularly practising their <span class="eb">swing</span> (way of hitting the ball). Many people who do not play golf enjoy a game of <span class="eb">crazy golf</span> (<span class="ei">AmE</span> <span class="eb">miniature golf</span>) in a local park. The idea is to hit a golf ball round a small grass and concrete course, through tunnels, over bridges, round small pools, etc. Others enjoy <span class="eb">putting</span>, a <span class="ndv">miniature</span> form of golf on a small grassy course.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">late Middle English</span></span> (originally <span class="lang">Scots</span>): perhaps related to <span class="lang">Dutch</span> <span class="ff">kolf</span> ‘club, bat’, used as a term in several Dutch games; <span class="etym_i">golf</span>, however, is recorded before these games.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Choose from over 100 golf packages in our brochure.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">His coach says his golf swing needs improving.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She decided to join a golf club.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She has a golf handicap of 18.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She’s been a golf widow since she gave her husband his first set of clubs.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The club is holding a golf clinic next week, where golfers can get advice from the pros.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The eighth at Banff is one of the world’s great golf holes.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The hotel offers miniature golf and other activities for children.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">You can borrow golf clubs if you want a game.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
