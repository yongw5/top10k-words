It is the <span class="eb">first language</span>, or <span class="eb">mother tongue</span>, of over 300 million people living in countries such as Britain, Ireland, the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa, and it is spoken as a <span class="eb">second language</span> by many millions in countries where English is an official language. English is learned by many more people <span class="ndv">worldwide</span> as a <span class="eb">foreign language</span>. English has many regional varieties such as South African English and Indian English and has also developed as a <span class="eb">global language</span> or <span class="eb">international language</span>, used as a <span class="eb">lingua franca</span> (shared language), sometimes called <span class="eb">ELF</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> English as a Lingua Franca<span class="wrap">)</span></span> between people for whom it is not a first language. It is estimated that now only one out of every four users of the language is a native speaker of English.</span><span class="p">English has achieved the status of a world language over a long period of time, and for various historical and cultural reasons. In the 17th century English was spread by <span class="ndv">settlers</span> going from Britain to America, and in the 18th and 19th centuries by the <span class="ndv">expansion</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> growth<span class="wrap">)</span></span> of the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">British Empire</span></span>. Many countries which were part of the empire kept English as their official language after independence because there were several local languages. As an official language, English is generally used in government, public administration and the law, and children may be taught in English. Since the middle of the 20th century, English has been an official language of international organizations such as the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">United Nations</span>.</span><span class="p">Economic factors are also important. Britain and the US are both major business and financial centres, and many <span class="ndv">multinational corporations</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> companies that operate in several countries<span class="wrap">)</span></span> started in these countries. Elsewhere, a knowledge of English is often seen as necessary for success in business, and in countries which have many tourists.</span><span class="p">Advances in technology and <span class="ndv">telecommunications</span> have also helped to establish English as a global language. Many inventions important to modern life, e.g. electricity, radio and the telephone, were developed in Britain or the US. English became the language for international communications in <span class="ndv">air traffic control</span> and <span class="ndv">shipping</span>. Now, major computer systems and software developers are based in the US, and English is one of the main languages used on the Internet.</span><span class="p">Britain and the US have invested in the development of <span class="eb">English Language Teaching</span> (<span class="eb">ELT</span>). The <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">British Council</span> has offices across the world which promote British culture and support the teaching of English. The United States also has libraries and cultural programmes in many countries. The English language broadcasts of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">BBC World Service</span>, <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Voice of America</span> and other services are widely popular, and many people listen to the news broadcasts in order to get news about events in their own country. The BBC and Voice of America also broadcast programmes for learners of English.</span><span class="p">As an international language, English continues to develop. People who speak English as a first or second language have their own variety of the language, each of which is changing independently of other varieties. There are many differences, for instance, between British English and American English, and between Australian, South African, Indian, African and Jamaican English, though all can be understood, more or less, by speakers of other varieties. Foreign learners of English learn one of the major varieties, usually British or American English, or some sort of international English. As a global language, English can no longer be thought of as belonging only to British or American people, or to anyone else. This loss of ownership is often uncomfortable, especially in Britain. As the number of people using English as a second or foreign language is increasing faster than the number who speak it as a first language, further drifts away from a British or American standard are likely.</span><span class="p">The status of English as a global language has unfortunately tended to mean that British and American people assume everyone speaks English, so they do not need to learn foreign languages. The numbers of students who study foreign languages have decreased.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#a6f0872728404f36ac66b21e6794bab2" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2</span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">uncountable</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">English language or literature as a subject of study</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a degree in English</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">English is my best subject.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#a6f0872728404f36ac66b21e6794bab2" class="sen"></a><span class="num">3</span><span class="v-gs" type="alt"><span class="v-g"><span class="v"><strong>the English</strong></span></span></span> <span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">plural</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">the people of England (sometimes wrongly used to mean the British, including the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish)</span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Old English</span></span> <span class="etym_i">Englisc</span> (from <span class="etym_i">Angle</span>, a Germanic people who came to England in 5th century AD + <span class="xr"><span class="xh">-ish</span></span>).
