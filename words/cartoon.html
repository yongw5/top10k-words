Most US newspapers contain comic strips that are read by both adults and children. On weekdays they are usually four frames long, printed in black and white. On Sundays they are longer and in colour. Comic strips are also popular in British newspapers. Some can be found on the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Internet</span>.</span><span class="p">Most comic strips make jokes about the characters in them and the things that happen to them. For instance, in the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Peanuts</span> strips (1950-2000) many of the jokes are about <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Charlie Brown</span></span>, who has very bad luck, and his friend Lucy, who is unkind to him. In <span class="ebi">Calvin and Hobbes</span> (1985-1995) , the humour comes from the relationship between a boy and his imaginary friend, a toy tiger. Comic strips in British newspapers include <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Andy Capp</span></span> and <span class="ebi">The Perishers</span>. In the US, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Dilbert</span> is about life in the office while <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Doonesbury</span>comments on political situations through its characters. Most newspapers also print single frames that comment in a humorous way on politicians and other people in the news. These are known as <span class="eb">cartoons</span>.</span><span class="p">In Britain a <span class="ei">comic</span> is a picture magazine, usually for children. Comics contain short stories written as comic strips, and sometimes also competitions and articles. Some parents do not approve of comics, but others argue that they encourage children to read. Popular children's comics include <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Beano</span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Dandy</span>, and <span class="ebi">2000 AD</span>, which features mainly <span class="ndv">science fiction</span> stories. Comics for very young children are often based on popular television programmes, such as <span class="ebi">Thomas and Friends</span> (which features <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Thomas the Tank Engine</span></span>). Adult comics, such as <span class="ebi">Viz</span>, are usually very rude.</span><span class="p">Some of the characters in <span class="ebi">Beano</span> and <span class="ebi">Dandy</span> have not changed much over the years and now look old-fashioned. Teachers, for instance, still wear mortar boards <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> stiff black hats with a square top<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, though real teachers stopped wearing them long ago. Many of the most popular comics appear in the form of books, called <span class="eb">annuals</span>, around Christmas each year.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Comic books</span> are similar to comics. Each book has a set of characters who have adventures. Many of the characters, such as <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Spider-Man</span></span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Superman</span> and Wonder Woman, have powers that ordinary people do not have.</span><span class="p">Pictures of the most famous characters from comic strips and comic books are used on a range of products, for example they are printed on bed covers, T-shirts, lunch boxes and birthday cards.</span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#9f5bd21d22b24da1a803d5ab08ccd33a" class="sen"></a><span class="num">3</span><span class="v-gs" type="vf"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">also</span> <span class="v-g"><span class="v"><strong>animated cartoon</strong></span></span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">a film/movie made by photographing a series of gradually changing drawings or models, so that they look as if they are moving</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a Walt Disney cartoon</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a cartoon character</span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#9f5bd21d22b24da1a803d5ab08ccd33a" class="sen"></a><span class="num">4</span><span class="label-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="reg">specialist</span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">a drawing made by an artist as a preparation for a painting</span> </li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def">late 16th cent.</span> <span class="xg">(in sense <span class="xs"><span class="wrap">(</span>4<span class="wrap">)</span></span>)</span>: from <span class="lang">Italian</span> <span class="ff">cartone</span>, from <span class="ff">carta</span>, from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">carta</span>, <span class="ff">charta</span>, from <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="ff">khartēs</span> ‘papyrus leaf’. <span class="xg">Sense <span class="xs"><span class="wrap">(</span>1<span class="wrap">)</span></span></span> dates from the mid 19th cent.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He draws strip cartoons for ‘The Guardian’.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The kids spend their Saturdays watching cartoons.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He started drawing cartoons when he was still at school.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The funniest contributions to the magazine are the cartoons.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a full-length Disney cartoon</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a political cartoon</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a strip cartoon</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
