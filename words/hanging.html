In the US the <span class="eb">death penalty</span> is used in many states. In 1972 the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Supreme Court</span> decided that it was ‘cruel and unusual punishment’, which the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Constitution</span> does not allow, and it became illegal until 1976, when the Court changed its mind.</span><span class="p">Each state decides what methods of <span class="eb">execution</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> killing<span class="wrap">)</span></span> will be used. This is usually a <span class="eb">lethal injection</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> an injection of a poisonous chemical<span class="wrap">)</span></span> but other methods used include the <span class="eb">electric chair</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a chair which sends a strong electric current through the prisoner's body<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, and, rarely, <span class="eb">hanging</span>, a <span class="eb">firing squad</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a group of soldiers who shoot the prisoner<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, and the <span class="eb">gas chamber</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a room that is filled with poisonous gas when the prisoner is inside<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">In the US the death penalty is passed on people found guilty of murder. Since 1976 over a thousand people have been <span class="ndv">executed</span>. Most people who receive the <span class="eb">death sentence</span> appeal to higher courts, and the sentence may be changed. The legal system moves slowly, so that a long time passes between the sentence being given and the execution taking place. The result is that there are about 3 000 prisoners <span class="eb">on death row</span>, i.e. waiting to be executed. The state governor can give a <span class="eb">stay of execution</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a delay so that the prisoner has time to appeal to another court<span class="wrap">)</span></span> or a <span class="eb">pardon</span>. This can happen at any time until the execution takes place.</span><span class="p">Another reason why many death sentences are not carried out is that there is strong opposition to capital punishment. People argue that it is immoral and that if a mistake is made it cannot be put right. They also say that the death penalty does not prevent people from committing murder. Another strong argument is that more African Americans who are found guilty of murder are sentenced to death than other racial groups and this is unfair.</span><span class="p">In Britain the death penalty for murder was <span class="ndv">abolished</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> ended<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in 1965, but it could still in theory be passed on anyone found guilty of treason <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> crimes against the state<span class="wrap">)</span></span> until 1998. Some British people think that the death penalty should be brought back for crimes such as <span class="ndv">terrorism</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the use of violence for political aims<span class="wrap">)</span></span> or the murder of a police officer, but Parliament has voted several times against this. In former times about 200 crimes were <span class="eb">capital offences</span>, <span class="ndv">punishable</span> by <span class="eb">hanging</span>. The wooden <span class="eb">gallows</span> or <span class="eb">gibbet</span> on which criminals were hanged can still be seen in some places. Many criminals were hanged in public at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Tyburn</span> in London, and later at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Newgate</span> prison. <span class="ndv">Traitors</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> people who betray their country<span class="wrap">)</span></span> were <span class="eb">hanged, drawn and quartered</span>, i.e. hanged on the gallows, then taken down while still alive and their <span class="ndv">intestines</span> cut out. Their heads were cut off and their bodies cut into four pieces.</span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#86e62c19878b407ca1c2299d093ae254" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2</span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">countable</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="gram">usually plural</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">a large piece of material that is hung on a wall for decoration</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">wall hangings</span></span></span> </li></span> </ol> </div></div>
