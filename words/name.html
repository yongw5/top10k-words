British and American children are given two personal names by their parents, a <span class="eb">first name</span> and a <span class="eb">middle name</span>. These names are sometimes called <span class="eb">Christian</span> names or <span class="eb">given</span> names. Some people have only one given name, a few have three or more. Friends and members of a family who are of similar age usually call one another by their first names. In some families young people now also call their aunts and uncles and even their parents by their first names. Outside the family, the expression <span class="ei">be on first name terms</span> suggests that the people concerned have a friendly, informal relationship, although it is also very common for strangers to call each other by their first names. </span><span class="p">When writing their name Americans commonly give their first name and their <span class="eb">middle initial</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> first letter of their middle name<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, e.g. <span class="ei">George M Cohan</span>. Both given names are used in full only on formal occasions, e.g. when people get married. In Britain many people <span class="eb">sign their name</span> on forms etc. using the <span class="ndv">initials</span> of both their given names and their surname, e.g. <span class="ei">J E Brooks</span>, but may write <span class="ei">Joanna Brooks</span> at the end of a letter. The <span class="eb">full name</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> all given names and surname<span class="wrap">)</span></span> is usually only required on official forms.</span><span class="p">Parents usually decide on given names for their children before they are born. In some families the oldest boy is given the same name as his father. In the US the word <span class="eb">junior</span> or <span class="eb">senior</span>, or a number, is added after the name and surname to make it clear which person is being referred to. For example, the son of <span class="ei">William Jones Sr</span> (Senior) would be called <span class="ei">William Jones Jr</span> (Junior), and <span class="ei">his</span> son would be called <span class="ei">William Jones III</span> ('William Jones the third').</span><span class="p">Many popular names come from the Bible, e.g. <span class="ei">Jacob</span>, <span class="ei">Joshua</span>, <span class="ei">Matthew</span>, <span class="ei">Mary</span>, <span class="ei">Rebecca</span> and <span class="ei">Sarah</span>, though this does not imply that the people who choose them are religious. Other people give their children the name of somebody they admire, such as a famous sports personality, or a film or pop star. In Britain the names <span class="ei">William</span> and <span class="ei">Harry</span> became common again after the sons of Prince Charles were given these names. In the US <span class="ei">Chelsea</span> was not a common name for a girl until President Bill Clinton's daughter Chelsea came to public attention.</span><span class="p">Names such as <span class="ei">David</span>, <span class="ei">Michael</span>, <span class="ei">Paul</span> and <span class="ei">Robert</span> for boys and <span class="ei">Catherine</span>, <span class="ei">Elizabeth</span> and <span class="ei">Jane</span> for girls remain popular for many years. Others, e.g. <span class="ei">Darrell</span>, <span class="ei">Darren</span>, <span class="ei">Wayne</span>, <span class="ei">Chloe</span>, <span class="ei">Jade</span> and <span class="ei">Zara</span>, are fashionable for only a short period. Names such as <span class="ei">Albert</span>, <span class="ei">Herbert</span>, <span class="ei">Wilfrid</span>, <span class="ei">Doris</span>, <span class="ei">Gladys</span> and <span class="ei">Joyce</span> are now out of fashion and are found mainly among older people. Some older names come back into fashion and there are now many young women called <span class="ei">Amy</span>, <span class="ei">Emma</span>, <span class="ei">Harriet</span>, <span class="ei">Laura</span> and <span class="ei">Sophie</span>. The birth announcements columns in newspapers give an indication of the names which are currently popular. In Britain these have included <span class="ei">Jack</span>, <span class="ei">Joshua</span> and <span class="ei">Thomas</span> for boys and <span class="ei">Emily</span>, <span class="ei">Ellie</span> and <span class="ei">Chloe</span> for girls and in the US <span class="ei">Jacob</span>, <span class="ei">Michael</span> and <span class="ei">Joshua</span> for boys and <span class="ei">Emily</span>, <span class="ei">Emma</span> and <span class="ei">Madison</span> for girls.</span><span class="p">People from Wales, Scotland or Ireland, or those who have a cultural background from outside Britain, may choose from an additional set of names. In the US Jews, <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">African Americans</span> or people of Latin American origin may also choose different names.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a
