In the US federal, state and local governments each have their own systems of law and of punishment. The <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Constitution</span> forbids ‘cruel and unusual punishment’, but it is the responsibility of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Supreme Court</span> to decide whether a punishment is ‘cruel and unusual’. In Britain, the Scottish legal system is different from that in England and Wales, but methods of punishment are similar throughout Britain.</span><span class="p">When an accused person is found guilty of a crime, the judge decides what punishment they should suffer. In both Britain and the US the least serious offences are punished by <span class="eb">fines</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> financial payments<span class="wrap">)</span></span> which must be paid to the court. Fines or <span class="eb">fixed penalties</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> fines at a level decided in advance<span class="wrap">)</span></span> are often <span class="eb">imposed</span> for minor traffic offences such as parking illegally and can be paid without the need to go to court.</span><span class="p">If a fine is not considered adequate, a person may be <span class="eb">sentenced</span> to do <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">community service</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> work without pay in hospitals, homes for old people, etc.<span class="wrap">)</span></span> or be put <span class="eb">on probation</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> required to have regular meetings with a social worker over a set period<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. When the crime committed is more serious, the <span class="eb">convicted</span> person <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> person found guilty<span class="wrap">)</span></span> is likely to be given a prison sentence. If it is their <span class="eb">first offence</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the first time a person has broken the law<span class="wrap">)</span></span> the sentence may be <span class="eb">suspended</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> only carried out if the person is found guilty of another crime<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and the person is allowed to remain free on a <span class="eb">conditional discharge</span>.</span><span class="p">If a person is given a prison sentence its length depends on how serious their crime is and on their past <span class="eb">record</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the number of crimes they have committed<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. If a person thinks the sentence is too severe they have the right to <span class="eb">appeal</span> against it in a higher court, which has the power to reduce the sentence. As a reward for good behaviour prisoners are often given <span class="eb">remission</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> are released early<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Others get <span class="eb">parole</span>, which means that they can go free as long as they do not commit any further crimes. In the US the number of people on probation has increased in recent years, as there is not always room in prisons for all those given a prison sentence. A variety of <span class="eb">non-custodial punishments</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> ones not requiring time in prison<span class="wrap">)</span></span> have been tried in both Britain and the US, including <span class="eb">electronic tagging</span>. This punishment requires people to wear a device that informs the police where they are.</span><span class="p">In Britain the maximum sentence that can be <span class="eb">handed down</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> decided<span class="wrap">)</span></span> by a judge is a <span class="eb">life sentence</span>, which in fact usually means spending about 20-25 years in prison. The most serious punishment in the US is the <span class="eb">death penalty</span>. Not all states allow <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">capital punishment</span>, and, in those that do, there may be many years of appeals before it can be carried out.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#65f0e8502dee4e0caa9edc686dfc5028" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2</span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">uncountable</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">rough treatment</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">The carpet by the door takes the most punishment.</span></span></span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">late Middle English</span></span>: from <span class="lang">Old French</span> <span class="ff">punissement</span>, from the verb <span class="ff">punir</span> ‘punish’, from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">punire</span>, from <span class="ff">poena</span> ‘penalty’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He had his privileges withdrawn as punishment for fighting with another prisoner.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He was compelled on pain of punishment to answer the question.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">It is unlawful for a teacher to inflict corporal punishment on pupils.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Punishments for killing the king’s deer were severe.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She had to tidy the classroom as punishment for being late.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Take your punishment like a man.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The victim’s family do not believe that this punishment fits the crime.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">They use a system of reward and punishment to discipline their children.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the sociology of crime and punishment</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He believed that certain forms of physical punishment could be effective in some cases.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He was sent to his room as a punishment.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The refugees could not return without fear of punishment.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">There is little evidence that harsher punishments deter people.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
