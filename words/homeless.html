and the US are <span class="eb">homeless</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> have nowhere to live<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Many are forced to <span class="eb">sleep on the streets</span> (<span class="ei">BrE</span> <span class="ei">also</span> <span class="eb">sleep rough</span> or be a <span class="eb">rough sleeper</span>) because they have nowhere else to go. Formerly, people who had no permanent home were called <span class="eb">tramps</span> or <span class="eb">vagrants</span>. Most were older people. Now, many younger people are homeless. In the US the typical image of a homeless person is of a single man or an older woman. The women are sometimes called <span class="eb">bag ladies</span>, because they carry their things around in large bags. But many families with small children are also homeless.</span><span class="p">Homeless people sleep in shop doorways, under bridges, or anywhere they can find away from the wind and rain. In Britain, the alternative to sleeping rough is to go to a <span class="eb">night shelter</span> or to <span class="eb">live in a squat</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> live in an empty house or flat without paying rent<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. In 2012, squatting was made a criminal offence in Britain.</span><span class="p">Not all homeless people sleep rough or squat. In Britain, the government aims to prevent sleeping rough and begging. Local councils are legally required to find somewhere for homeless families to live, and many families are housed in <span class="eb">bed-and-breakfast accommodation</span>. Charities such as <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Shelter</span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Centre Point</span></span> and the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Salvation Army</span> provide help and advice and run <span class="eb">hostels</span> for the homeless. Each winter around Christmas, they also organize <span class="ndv">campaigns</span> which raise money to provide extra night shelters and <span class="eb">soup kitchens</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> places giving free hot food<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">In the US many towns have laws making it illegal to sleep on the streets, so the police may tell people to move during the night. The US also has shelters but it is not easy to get a bed in one. Many do not have enough space, or have only enough money to stay open for part of the year. They are often away from the centre of town, and people need to have money for the bus <span class="ndv">fare</span> to get there.</span><span class="p">For many people, homelessness begins when they lose their jobs and cannot pay their rent. Some become homeless as a result of family quarrels, broken relationships, violence, and mental illness. Some homeless people survive by <span class="eb">begging</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> asking for money<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. In Britain homeless people have an opportunity to help themselves by selling <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">The Big Issue</span></span> magazine: they buy copies of the magazine and sell them at a higher, fixed price to members of the public. There are similar publications in the US, but they are less popular.</span><span class="p">Many people give to charities, or to the homeless on the streets, but some think homeless people are <span class="ndv">wasters</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> spend money carelessly<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, or are too lazy to work, and are responsible for their own situation. Americans generally believe that people should work hard to help themselves, instead of taking money from the government. For that reason, many Americans will give money to charities, but are opposed to a system of government benefits. But homeless people who have no address have difficulty getting the limited kinds of help available from the government.</span></span></span></span></li></span> </ol> </div></div>
