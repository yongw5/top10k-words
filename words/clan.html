In the 11th century, tribes living in Scotland divided into small clans that settled round <span class="ndv">lochs</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> lakes<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="ndv">glens</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> valleys<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, and on the islands. Among the most powerful were the Campbells and the MacGregors of Argyll, the MacLeods and the MacDonalds of the Western Isles, the MacKays of Caithness and the Stewarts of Appin. The <span class="eb">chief</span> of each clan had complete authority. <span class="eb">Clansmen</span> were known by the name of their father, and this was shown by the <span class="ndv">prefix</span> <span class="ei">Mac-</span> added to the father's name. Many Scottish surnames begin with <span class="ei">Mac-</span>. Clan <span class="ndv">membership</span> did not in fact depend on sharing the same name, and many clan members were not related to the chief, but were admitted to the clan as loyal supporters.</span><span class="p">The clans often fought one another. The most famous argument was between the Campbells and the MacDonalds. After <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">William III</span></span> became king in 1688, many clans joined the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Jacobites</span> who supported the former <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Roman Catholic</span> king, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">James II</span></span>. When William ordered all the clans to swear <span class="ndv">allegiance</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> swear that they would be loyal<span class="wrap">)</span></span> to himself, the MacDonalds of <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Glencoe</span> failed to do so. The Campbells were sent to punish them, resulting in the Massacre of Glencoe (1692) , in which many MacDonalds were murdered.</span><span class="p">The clans fought together with the Jacobites against the English in 1715 and again, under <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Bonny Prince Charlie</span></span>, in 1745, but they were finally defeated at <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">the Battle of Culloden</span></span> (1746) . Many clansmen were killed or put in prison. Shortly afterwards, the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Highland Clearances</span></span>, in which the <span class="ndv">crofts</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> small farms<span class="wrap">)</span></span> of many Scots were destroyed by the landowners to make way for sheep farming, further reduced the influence of the clans.</span><span class="p">After Culloden, the clans were forbidden to wear <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">tartan</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> woollen cloth with large, coloured squares<span class="wrap">)</span></span> because it was thought to be a symbol of the desire for an independent Scotland. A tartan <span class="eb">kilt</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> man's knee-length pleated skirt<span class="wrap">)</span></span> was an important part of a clansman's traditional clothing, but individual tartan patterns were not associated with a particular clan until <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Victorian</span> times. Today, Scotsmen generally only wear kilts on special occasions.</span><span class="p">Clans are still important in Scotland, especially in the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Highlands</span>. Many people outside Scotland, especially in the US, also take pride in having Scottish ancestors and being members of a clan.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">late Middle English</span></span>: from <span class="lang">Scottish Gaelic</span> <span class="ff">clann</span> ‘offspring, family’, from <span class="lang">Old Irish</span> <span class="ff">cland</span>, from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">planta</span> ‘sprout’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He became clan chief after his father’s death.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Heavy fighting between rival clans was reported.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">His grandfather was a descendant of the Guthrie clan in Scotland.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">In past times, it was a meeting place for local clans.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She’s one of a growing clan of stars who have left Hollywood.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The political allegiances of the Highland clans were complex.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">There’s a photo of the whole Kennedy clan on the bookshelf.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
