well as on their tastes. In Britain Friday and Saturday evenings in most city centres are busy, with crowds of mainly young people moving between cinemas, pubs, clubs and wine bars. In the country people often go to the local pub but if they want more choice of entertainment they have to travel to a town. Similarly in the US, people living in New York City have very different possibilities for a good <span class="eb">night out</span> compared with those living in small towns.</span><span class="p"><span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Pubs</span> in Britain attract a wide range of age groups. Older people tend to choose quieter pubs where conversation is easier than in the pubs popular among younger people, where loud music is played. The main activity is drinking, usually beer or <span class="ndv">lager</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a type of pale light beer<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. People have to be over 18 to drink alcohol. Some pubs also have live music. <span class="eb">Pub crawls</span>, in which several pubs are visited in one evening, are popular with younger people. When pubs close people may look for something to eat or go to a <span class="eb">club</span>.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Wine bars</span> and <span class="eb">cocktail bars</span> are usually smarter than pubs and more expensive. In the US <span class="eb">bars</span> range from those popular with students, where the beer is cheap, to those in hotels where customers must dress smartly. <span class="eb">Bartenders</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the people who serve the drinks<span class="wrap">)</span></span> make hundreds of different drinks by combining various kinds of alcohol. The British custom of buying a round, when each person in a group takes a turn to buy a drink for everyone else, is not always the rule in the US. Sometimes each person pays for his or her own drinks, or a group might <span class="eb">run a tab</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the bartender writes down what they have<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and then everyone pays part of the bill when they leave. Some bars provide free <span class="ndv">snacks</span>, especially during <span class="eb">happy hour</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a time around 5 p.m. when drinks cost less<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. In the US people must be over 21 to drink alcohol. There are special alcohol-free bars for <span class="ndv">teenagers</span>.</span><span class="p">A popular activity among young people is to <span class="eb">go clubbing</span>, i.e. go to clubs where they can drink and dance. There is a charge for admission and drinks are usually more expensive than in pubs. Cities like New York and London are famous for their clubs. The music is usually modern dance music but some play <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">soul</span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">jazz</span> or pop.</span><span class="p">People living in or near a city or town can go to the <span class="eb">cinema</span> (<span class="ei">AmE</span> <span class="eb">movie theater</span>) or <span class="eb">theatre</span> or to a concert. The biggest concert venues in Britain include the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Albert Hall</span></span> in London and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">National Exhibition Centre</span></span> in Birmingham. In the US people occasionally go to <span class="eb">dinner theater</span>: they sit at tables in a theatre for a meal and stay there afterwards to watch a play. Other places to go include comedy clubs, where comedians perform live, and sports events.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Gambling</span> is illegal in some parts of the US but in <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Las Vegas</span></span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Atlantic City</span></span> there are many casinos where people can gamble. Some communities run <span class="eb">bingo</span> games for low stakes <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> bets<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. In Britain there are casinos and bingo is also popular.</span><span class="p">Going out for dinner in a restaurant is a very popular activity. Many people also enjoy entertaining at home. They may have a <span class="eb">dinner party</span> for a few friends or a <span class="eb">party</span> with drinks and snacks to which many people are invited.</span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
