Some names are derived from a feature of the countryside. Others are named after a church or fort. Some honour famous people, while others have been brought from abroad.</span><span class="p">Many names reflect the history of an area and of the people who once lived there. Some of the oldest place names in Wales and Scotland date back to the time of the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Celts</span>. Some towns in Southern England have Latin names dating from <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Roman</span> times. Other names are of <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Anglo-Saxon</span> or <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Viking</span> origin and date from the period when these peoples invaded Britain. Later, the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Normans</span> introduced some French names.</span><span class="p">In the US many place names are derived from <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Native American</span> words: Chicago, for example, means 'place of the onion' in the Algonquian language, Seattle is named after a chief, and Natchez after a tribe. Sometimes the names were translated, sometimes not: the Black Warrior River in Alabama runs through the city of Tuscaloosa, which was named after a Native American whose name means 'Black Warrior'. Names of Spanish origin are found mainly in the South-Western US. They include San Francisco, San Diego, Las Vegas and Los Angeles. A few names are of French origin, e.g. Baton Rouge and La Crosse. Some names are derived from more than one culture: Anaheim combines the Spanish name 'Ana' with the German 'heim' <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> home<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">Many British towns take their name from a river. In Wales and Scotland many towns have names beginning with <span class="ei">Aber-</span>, which means 'river mouth', e.g. Aberystwyth, Aberdeen. In England towns close to a river mouth often end with <span class="ei">-mouth</span>, e.g. Weymouth. The name of the river forms the rest of the name. Names ending in <span class="ei">-ford</span> (Oxford) suggest a place where a river is shallow enough to cross. A town beside a lake may, in Scotland, contain <span class="ei">loch-</span> or, in England, <span class="ei">-mere</span>, e.g. Lochinver, Windermere.</span><span class="p">In Scotland, there are several place names beginning with <span class="ei">Dun-</span>, meaning 'hill', e.g. Dunbar. Any place whose name ends with <span class="ei">-don</span> (Swindon), <span class="ei">-hurst</span> (Sandhurst), <span class="ei">-head</span> (Gateshead) or, in Wales, begins with <span class="ei">pen-</span> (Penarth), probably stands on or near a hill. Towns near passes may end in <span class="ei">-gate</span>, e.g. Harrogate, or, in Scotland, begin with <span class="ei">Glen-</span>, e.g. Glencoe. Names ending with <span class="ei">-coumbe</span> or <span class="ei">-combe</span> (Ilfracombe) or <span class="ei">-dale</span> (Rochdale), or, in Wales, beginning with <span class="ei">cwm-</span> (Cwmbran) suggest that the town is in a valley.</span><span class="p">American place names based on natural features are easier to recognize. Examples include Two Rivers, River Edge, Mirror Lake, Ocean City, Gulf Breeze, Seven Hills, Shady Valley, Twentynine Palms, Lookout, Little Rock, Round Rock, White Rock and Slippery Rock. French names include La Fontaine and Eau Claire. Some place names describe a product, e.g. Bean City, Copper City.</span><span class="p">Many British towns developed around an early fort or castle. This may be indicated by a name ending in <span class="ei">-burgh</span> (Edinburgh), <span class="ei">-bury</span> (Salisbury), <span class="ei">-caster</span> or <span class="ei">-cester</span> (Doncaster, Gloucester) or <span class="ei">-chester</span> (Dorchester), or beginning or ending with <span class="ei">castle</span> (Newcastle). A Welsh variant is <span class="ei">Caer-</span> (Caernarfon).</span><span class="p">Names that include <span class="ei">church-</span>, <span class="ei">kirk-</span> or, in Wales <span class="ei">llan-</span> refer to a church (Offchurch, Kirkby, Llandaff). Towns where there was a monastery may have names ending in <span class="ei">-minster</span> (Kidderminster).</span><span class="p">Names ending with <span class="ei">-ham</span> (Evesham), <span class="ei">-hampton</span> (Southampton), <span class="ei">-ington</span> (Workington), <span class="ei">-stock</span> or <span class="ei">-stoke</span> (Woodstock, Basingstoke), <span class="ei">-thorpe</span> (Scunthorpe), <span class="ei">-wich</span> or <span class="ei">-wick</span> (Norwich, Warwick) mean that there was a village or farm there.</span><span class="p">In the US place names that refer to buildings include House, Brick Church and High Bridge. Atlanta, Georgia is named after a railway/​railroad.</span><span class="p">Some British place names refer to ancient tribes. The elements <span class="ei">-ing</span> and <span class="ei">-ingham</span> at the end of a name mean 'people of' and 'home of the people of', as in Reading ('Read's people') and Birmingham ('home of Beorma's people'). Places with names ending in <span class="ei">-by</span> were the homes of Viking invaders, e.g. Grimsby ('Grim's village').</span><span class="p">Some towns take their name from Christian saints, particularly if they had local connections. These include St Albans, St Andrews and St David's. Towns named after people who lived in more recent times are rare in Britain. They include Nelson, named after <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Lord Nelson</span></span> and the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">new town</span> Telford, named after the engineer Thomas Telford.</span><span class="p">By contrast, many towns in the US honour famous Americans, especially presidents. Abraham <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Lincoln</span> is honoured in towns named Lincoln, Lincolnville, Lincolnwood, etc., <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Andrew Jackson</span></span> at Jackson and Jacksonville and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Thomas Jefferson</span></span> at Jefferson, Jeffersonville and Jefferson City.</span><span class="p">Other towns named after famous Americans include Houston, Texas, named after Sam <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Houston</span>; Cody, Wyoming, after <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Buffalo Bill</span></span>; Boone, Tennessee, after <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Daniel Boone</span></span>; and Custer, Montana, after <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">General George Custer</span></span>. Often the person is now little heard of, e.g. H M Shreve, a 19th century boat captain on the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Mississippi River</span></span>, whose name was used for Shreveport, Louisiana. A few towns are named after companies, e.g. <span class="ndv">Hershey</span>, Pennsylvania.</span><span class="p">Many American towns are named after a place in Britain or another country from which settlers in the US originally came. British names are found especially in <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">New England</span>. They include Boston, Cambridge, Gloucester, Manchester-by-the-sea, and Stafford. British names used in other parts of the US include the cities of New York and Birmingham, and Glasgow, a small town in Montana. Like New York (New Amsterdam), Brooklyn (Breukelyn) was originally named by Dutch settlers.</span><span class="p">Names from other countries include New Orleans, Moscow, Athens, Paris, Naples and New Holland.</span><span class="p">Americans enjoy creating unusual or humorous names, such as Tombstone in Arizona. Truth or Consequences in New Mexico is named after a radio quiz show. Other names include Cannon Ball, Pie Town, Smackover, Humble City, High Lonesome, Cut and Shoot, and Monkey's Eyebrow.</span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a
