Many people spend it with their family or have a short holiday/​vacation. It is also an important Christian festival. <span class="eb">Easter Sunday</span>, the day of the Resurrection <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the day when Christians believe Christ rose from the dead and became alive again<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, is the end of <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Lent</span> and the most important date in the Christian year. Many people who do not go to church at other times go on Easter Sunday. It was once common for people to wear new clothes to church on this day. Women wore new hats, called <span class="eb">Easter bonnets</span>. Today, people sometimes make <span class="ndv">elaborately</span> decorated Easter bonnets for fun. A few people send <span class="eb">Easter cards</span> with religious symbols on them or pictures of small chickens, lambs, rabbits and spring flowers, all traditionally associated with Easter.</span><span class="p">The Friday before Easter Sunday is called <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Good Friday</span> and is remembered as the day Christ was <span class="ndv">crucified</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> hanged on a cross to die<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. On Good Friday many people eat <span class="eb">hot cross buns</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> fruit buns decorated with a simple cross<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. The Monday after Easter is called <span class="eb">Easter Monday</span>. In Britain, Good Friday and Easter Monday are both <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">bank holidays</span>. In the US, each company decides for itself whether to close or remain open on those days.</span><span class="p">Children look forward to Easter Sunday because they are given chocolate <span class="eb">Easter eggs</span>. These are also popular with adults and millions are sold in the weeks before Easter. Many are packed in coloured <span class="ndv">foil</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> shiny paper<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in brightly-coloured boxes decorated with pictures of cartoon characters. Others are decorated with sugar flowers and wrapped in clear paper tied with a ribbon. Some shops write the person's name on the egg with <span class="ndv">icing</span> (<span class="ei">AmE</span> <span class="ndv">frosting</span>). Inside each egg are sweets or chocolates. Smaller eggs with a sweet cream inside are also popular. Eggs represent new life and the start of spring, and children sometimes colour the shells of real eggs at home. In some parts of Britain Easter is a time for traditional events such as <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">egg-rolling</span></span>.</span><span class="p">When American children wake up on Easter morning, they hope that the <span class="eb">Easter Bunny</span> has been. The Easter Bunny is an imaginary rabbit, and parents tell their children that it goes from house to house while they are sleeping. The Easter Bunny brings an <span class="eb">Easter basket</span> with chocolate eggs and other sweet things, or hides in the house small plastic eggs filled with sweets or little presents. When they wake up all the children run about trying to find the eggs. The Easter Bunny also often brings chocolate in the shape of a rabbit. In Britain some families now organize an Easter egg hunt, and people buy chocolate rabbits as well as eggs.</span></span></span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Old English</span></span> <span class="etym_i">ēastre</span>; of <span class="lang">Germanic</span> origin and related to <span class="lang">German</span> <span class="ff">Ostern</span> and <span class="xr"><span class="xh">east</span></span>; perhaps from <span class="etym_i">Ēastre</span>, the name of a goddess associated with spring.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Easter is early this year.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Have a good Easter.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I prefer to spend Easter at home.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Many people attend an Easter service at their local church.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Our next holiday is at Easter.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The house opens to the public at Easter.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The library is closed over Easter.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We usually go away for Easter.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the Easter story in the Bible</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
