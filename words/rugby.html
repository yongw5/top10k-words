There are two <span class="eb">codes</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> varieties<span class="wrap">)</span></span> of rugby football, <span class="eb">Rugby Union</span> and <span class="eb">Rugby League</span>, which have slightly different rules and scoring systems. In Rugby League each team has 13 players, compared with 15 in Rugby Union. Players sometimes change from one code to the other during their careers.</span><span class="p">In rugby, teams try to <span class="eb">win possession</span> of a large oval-shaped ball and carry or kick it towards the opposing team's <span class="eb">goal line</span>, the line at each end of the <span class="eb">pitch</span> where the H-shaped <span class="eb">goalposts</span> are.

It is said to have begun at <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Rugby School</span></span> in 1823. Rugby Union is played mainly by men, though there are now some women's teams.</span><span class="p">Rugby League broke away from Rugby Union in the 1890s. Rugby had become popular among adults in northern England and many could not afford to take time off work to play in matches without being paid. The Northern Union, later called the <span class="eb">Rugby League</span>, was formed in 1895 and soon had many full-time paid professional players. The two codes may reunite in the future, particularly since in 1995 the International Rugby Board allowed Rugby Union players to become paid professionals. Major competitions for professional teams include the <span class="eb">English Premiership</span>, the <span class="eb">RFU Championship</span> and the <span class="eb">Pro12</span>.</span><span class="p">National Rugby Union teams from England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland play against each other for the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">triple crown</span></span>. The teams also play with France and Italy each year in the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">the Six Nations Tournament</span></span>, and against Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and other countries. The <span class="eb">Rugby World Cup</span> is held every four years. Major international grounds include <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Twickenham</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Murrayfield</span>.</span><span class="p">Most Americans have little knowledge of rugby and in the US it is mostly played by amateur players <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> people who are not paid for playing<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in colleges and universities. Rugby was first played in the US in 1874 at <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Harvard University</span></span>, but after the development of American football in about 1880 it almost disappeared. It continued to be played in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">California</span>, but it was not until 1975 that the USA Rugby Football Union was established in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Denver</span>. By 1998, 1 420 clubs were associated with the organization.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">In rugby circles, there is nothing but criticism for the coverage of sport on terrestrial TV.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Kids from six years old play mini rugby at the club.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The crowd enjoyed the Fijians’ running rugby.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the former rugby international, Serge Blanco</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
