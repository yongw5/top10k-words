humour</span> (<span class="ei">AmE</span> <span class="eb">humor</span>), an ability to see the <span class="eb">funny side of life</span>, is considered essential by most British and American people. Everyone needs to be able to <span class="eb">laugh at themselves</span> sometimes, and to recognize that the situation they are in may look funny to others. It is considered a serious criticism of somebody to say that they have no sense of humour. When people are trying to meet other people, for example on an <span class="eb">Internet dating site</span>, they often ask for possible partners to have a <span class="eb">GSOH</span> (good sense of humour).</span><span class="p">Some people have a <span class="eb">dry</span> sense of humour, and can <span class="eb">keep a straight face</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> not smile<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and let their voice sound as though they are being serious when they are joking. Other people are said to be <span class="eb">witty</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> show a very clever type of humour<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. A person's sense of humour is influenced by many things, including family and social background and age.</span><span class="p">British and American humour on stage have some important differences, although the fact that some <span class="eb">comedy</span> television programmes are popular in both countries shows that there is common ground. Some American <span class="eb">sitcoms</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> shows in which the humour comes from situations that the characters get into<span class="wrap">)</span></span> such as <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Frasier</span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Friends</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Seinfeld</span> have been as popular in Britain as some of its own sitcoms. Sitcoms often have a <span class="eb">laugh track</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a recording of people laughing<span class="wrap">)</span></span> so that the audience at home will laugh in the right places. In many sitcoms gentle fun is made of ordinary life without the risk of causing anyone serious offence.</span><span class="p">American stage humour is more direct than British comedy. In the American series <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Cheers</span>, for instance, the humour comes from characters like Coach and Woody being more stupid than any real person could possibly be. But in the British comedy <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Fawlty Towers</span></span> Basil Fawlty's funny characteristics are exaggerated versions of those found in the type of Englishman he represents. <span class="eb">Slapstick</span> comedy, which is based on people falling over, bumping into each other, etc. is now less popular in Britain.</span><span class="p">British comedy makes frequent use of <span class="eb">irony</span>, humour which depends on a writer or performer suggesting the opposite of what is actually expressed. Many novels, films, stage plays, etc. use irony, even when discussing serious subjects such as death. Popular humour may sometimes rely on <span class="eb">double entendre</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> using a phrase that can be understood in two ways, one of which is usually sexual<span class="wrap">)</span></span> or on <span class="eb">innuendo</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> making an indirect suggestion of something rude<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. These were both used a lot in the popular series of <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Carry On</span> films that began in the 1960s.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Satire</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> making people or institutions appear ridiculous to show how foolish or bad they are<span class="wrap">)</span></span> is an important element of popular British political comedy programmes. One of the most successful British comedy series, which also became popular in the US, was <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Monty Python's Flying Circus</span></span>. It had a <span class="eb">zany</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> odd and silly<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="eb">satirical</span> humour which appealed especially to young people.</span><span class="p"><span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Comic strips</span> and <span class="eb">cartoons</span>, whether printed in newspapers, shown on television or the Internet or made into films, are popular in both the US and Britain. The most famous include <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Peanuts</span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Tom and Jerry</span></span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">The Simpsons</span></span>.</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Stand-up comedians</span> perform on television or in clubs, telling <span class="eb">gags</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> jokes<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and funny stories which end with a <span class="eb">punch line</span>, the part where the audience is supposed to laugh. Many comedians <span class="eb">tell jokes</span> that are funny because of some racial or sexual innuendo, and this may be considered unacceptable for family audiences. In Britain, common targets of comedians include mothers-in-law, foreigners and people from particular parts of Britain, especially Scotsmen (who are supposed to hate spending money) and Irishmen (who are supposed to be stupid). Many people find such jokes offensive, and the new generation of comedians has avoided making fun of people's race. Another form of comedy is for people from minority groups to make fun of their own customs and attitudes.</span><span class="p">Many people tell jokes at school, at home and at the office. People may start a speech with a joke or funny story to help <span class="eb">break the ice</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> make people feel more relaxed<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">Children tell jokes that involve a play on words, such as <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">knock-knock jokes</span></span> or ‘What do you call ..’ jokes e.g. ‘What do you call a man with a seagull on his head?’ ‘Cliff’.</span><span class="p">Adults sometimes tell what in the US are called <span class="eb">Polish jokes</span> because they are about a particular national or racial group. There are also jokes about blondes <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> women with fair hair<span class="wrap">)</span></span> being stupid, and lawyers having bad characters. For instance, ‘Why do they do lab experiments on lawyers?’ ‘Because there are some things that even a rat won't do.’ On the whole this type of humour is considered dated and in bad taste. <span class="eb">Light bulb jokes</span> make fun of the worst characteristic of any group of people, by suggesting mistakes they would make in trying to change a light bulb: ‘How many psychologists does it take to change a light bulb?’ - ‘Just one, but it has to really want to change.’</span><span class="p"><span class="eb">Practical jokes</span> involve tricking people, and are not usually very popular, but on <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">April Fool's Day</span></span> (1 April) people traditionally play practical jokes on each other. Newspapers often include a story that is not true hoping that some readers will believe it and then feel silly.</span></span></span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">late Middle English</span></span> (as a genre of drama, also denoting a narrative poem with a happy ending, as in Dante's <span class="etym_i">Divine Comedy</span>): from <span class="lang">Old French</span> <span class="ff">comedie</span>, via <span class="lang">Latin</span> from <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="ff">kōmōidia</span>, from <span class="ff">kōmōidos</span> ‘comic poet’, from <span class="ff">kōmos</span> ‘revel’ + <span class="ff">aoidos</span> ‘singer’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Does he play comedy?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The case quickly became a comedy of errors.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The show contains some wonderful slapstick comedy.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a popular romantic comedy</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He didn’t appreciate the comedy of the situation.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">It’s a romantic comedy starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The visual comedy of this scene is obvious.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">They spent hours watching comedy on television.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
