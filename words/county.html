Three regions, the counties of <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Essex</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Kent</span> and the region of <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Sussex</span> (which includes the counties of East and West Sussex), have the same names and cover almost the same areas as three of the former <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Anglo-Saxon</span> <span class="ndv">kingdoms</span>. Other counties, e.g. <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Dorset</span>, are probably based on areas where particular tribes once lived.</span><span class="p">Counties were previously called <span class="eb">shires</span>. The original shires were the counties of the English <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Midlands</span> and the word became part of their name, e.g. <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Northamptonshire</span>. Administrative and legal affairs were dealt with by shire courts <span class="ndv">presided</span> over by shire-reeves, later called <span class="ndv">sheriffs</span>. Many shires were divided into smaller districts called <span class="eb">hundreds</span>. The large former county of <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Yorkshire</span> was until 1974 divided into <span class="eb">ridings</span>, North Riding, East Riding and West Riding, named after the three divisions of the 9th century <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Viking</span> kingdom of <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">York</span>.</span><span class="p">The families of people who own land in the <span class="eb">shire counties</span>, are sometimes described as <span class="eb">county</span>, as in <span class="ei">a county family</span>, or are said to belong to the <span class="eb">county set</span>. Such people have a high social status and are thought to have a way of life that is typical of the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">upper class</span>.</span><span class="p">Counties were for a long time the basis for <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">local government</span>. Since 1972 there have been many changes to their boundaries and names, and to the structure of local government. Most recently, <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">unitary authorities</span> have been created throughout Wales and in many places in England, and a similar system of <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">council areas</span> introduced in Scotland. The main difference is that counties have two <span class="ndv">tiers</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> levels<span class="wrap">)</span></span> of local government, at county and at district level, and unitary authorities and council areas have only one level. Some towns that were previously part of counties, e.g. <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Southampton</span>, are now separate unitary authorities. Many people are confused by all the changes and continue to use the old county names. People do not like to have changes forced upon them, and in 1974 local people were unhappy when the small county of <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Rutland</span> was <span class="ndv">abolished</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> was said no longer to exist<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and became part of <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Leicestershire</span>. In 1996, when they had the opportunity to change, the people of Rutland chose to have their own separate unitary authority.</span><span class="p">In the US most states are divided into counties, which are the largest units of local government. There are over 3 000 counties in the US; Delaware has just three, while Texas has 254. <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Connecticut</span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Rhode Island</span></span> have none. In <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Louisiana</span>, similar units of local government are called <span class="eb">parishes</span>, and in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Alaska</span> they are called <span class="eb">boroughs</span>. In some urban areas, such as <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Philadelphia</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Boston</span>, the city takes up almost the entire county.</span></span></span></span></span></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Middle English</span></span>: from <span class="lang">Old French</span> <span class="ff">conte</span>, from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">comitatus</span>, from <span class="ff">comes</span>, <span class="ff">comit-</span> ‘companion, overseer, attendant’ (in <span class="lang">late Latin</span> ‘person holding a state office’), from <span class="ff">com-</span> ‘together with’ + <span class="ff">it-</span> ‘gone’ (from the verb <span class="ff">ire</span> ‘go’).
