The name <span class="ei">Gypsy</span> comes from the word ‘Egyptian’ because Gypsies were once thought to have come from Egypt. Some people now believe that they originally came from India. In the US Gypsies are called <span class="eb">Roma</span>, and in Britain they are known as <span class="eb">Romanies</span> or <span class="eb">travellers</span>, although the name travellers is more often used for Irish travellers, a group in Britain who, like Gypsies, do not live in settled communities but travel about from place to place living in <span class="ndv">caravans</span>. The traditional language of the Gypsies is <span class="eb">Romani</span>, and new words are made up from Romani elements rather than borrowed from English.</span><span class="p">Roma or Romanies, like many other <span class="ndv">minority</span> groups, have a strong sense of pride in their identity. In Britain, they are sometimes treated with fear and suspicion by the rest of the population and are often forced to move on from places where they stop.</span><span class="p">Gypsies usually make money by selling new and second-hand goods. Some collect and sell <span class="ndv">scrap</span> metal, while others do agricultural work. A few make a living from entertainment and singing. The women are known for selling <span class="ndv">clothes pegs</span>, ‘lucky’ white <span class="ndv">heather</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a wild plant<span class="wrap">)</span></span> or bunches of flowers. Many meet each year at the Appleby Horse Fair in Cumbria.</span><span class="p">Gypsies have always been associated with <span class="eb">fortune-telling</span>. They can be found at <span class="ndv">fairgrounds</span> predicting people's future by reading their <span class="ndv">palms</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> examining their hands<span class="wrap">)</span></span> or looking into a <span class="ndv">crystal</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> clear glass<span class="wrap">)</span></span> ball. Because of the mystery associated with their origins and their magical powers, Gypsies have a popular romantic image that conflicts with the reality of families living on dirty <span class="ndv">caravan sites</span> and being moved on by council officials or the police. Americans have little contact with Gypsies and think of the Roma only as exciting, mysterious people who wear brightly coloured clothes and gold jewellery and have unusual powers. The romantic image was taken up by the US <span class="ndv">striptease</span> artist <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a woman who takes her clothes off for an audience<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, Rose Havoc, who called herself <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Gypsy Rose Lee</span></span> on stage. In Britain a character called Mystic Meg used to appear on television each week, dressed in strange clothes and with an extravagant air of mystery, to predict the winners of the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">National Lottery</span></span>.</span></span></span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Attractive discounts are available to frequent travellers.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Her father was a commercial traveller who sold kitchenware.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">His travel books have given pleasure to generations of armchair travellers.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I got to know my fellow travellers quite well in the course of the three-day journey.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I’m not a great traveller.
