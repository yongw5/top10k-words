class="eb">get married</span>. <span class="ei">Marriage</span> is the state of being married, though the word can also mean the wedding ceremony.</span><span class="p">Before getting married a couple usually <span class="eb">get engaged</span>. It is traditional for the man to <span class="eb">propose</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> ask his girlfriend to marry him<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and, if she accepts, to give his new <span class="eb">fiancée</span> an <span class="eb">engagement ring</span>, which she wears on the third finger of her left hand. Today many couples decide together to get married. In England, Wales and Scotland, and in some states of the US, it is legal for couples of the same sex to marry.</span><span class="p">The couple then <span class="eb">set a date</span> and decide who will perform the marriage ceremony and where it will be held. In the US judges and religious leaders can perform weddings. Religious weddings are often held in a church or chapel, but the ceremony can take place anywhere and couples often choose somewhere that is special to them. In Britain many couples still prefer to be married in church, even if they are not religious. Others choose a <span class="eb">civil ceremony</span> conducted by a <span class="eb">registrar</span> at a <span class="eb">registry office</span>, or, since 1994 when the law was changed, at one of the many hotels and historic buildings which are licensed for weddings.</span><span class="p">Traditionally, the family of the <span class="eb">bride</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the woman who is to be married<span class="wrap">)</span></span> paid for the wedding, but today the couple usually pay part of the cost. Many people choose a traditional wedding with a hundred or more <span class="eb">guests</span>. Before the wedding, the couple send out printed <span class="eb">invitations</span> and guests buy a gift for them, usually something for their home. In the US couples <span class="eb">register</span> at a store by leaving there a list of presents they would like. Guests go to the store to look at the list and buy a present. In Britain couples send a <span class="eb">wedding list</span> to guests or, as in America, open a <span class="eb">bride's book</span> in a large store.</span><span class="p">Before a wedding can take place in a church it must be announced there on three occasions. This is called <span class="eb">the reading of the banns</span>. Some religious groups refuse to allow a couple to marry in church if either of them has been divorced, but they may agree to <span class="eb">bless</span> the marriage after a civil ceremony.</span><span class="p">Before the wedding the bride and <span class="eb">bridegroom</span> or <span class="eb">groom</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> her future husband<span class="wrap">)</span></span> often go to separate parties given for them by friends. At the groom's <span class="eb">stag party</span> guests drink alcohol and joke about how the groom is going to lose his freedom. For the bride there is a <span class="eb">hen party</span>, called in the US a <span class="eb">bachelorette party</span>. Sometimes these parties take the form of a weekend trip to a foreign city.</span><span class="p">At the wedding the groom's closest male friend acts as the <span class="eb">best man</span> and stands next to him during the ceremony. Other friends act as <span class="eb">ushers</span> and show guests where to sit. The bride's closest woman friend is <span class="eb">chief bridesmaid</span> (<span class="ei">AmE</span> <span class="eb">maid of honour</span>), or <span class="eb">matron of honour</span> if she is married, and other friends are <span class="eb">bridesmaids</span>. Children are bridesmaids if they are girls or <span class="eb">pages</span> if they are boys.</span><span class="p">Many women choose to have a <span class="eb">white wedding</span>, and wear a long white <span class="eb">wedding dress</span>, with a <span class="eb">veil</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a piece of thin white material<span class="wrap">)</span></span> covering the face. The bride's wedding clothes should include 'something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue', to bring luck. The bridesmaids wear matching dresses specially made for the occasion and, like the bride, carry <span class="eb">bouquets</span> of flowers. The bridegroom, the best man and other men may wear <span class="eb">morning dress</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a long-tailed jacket, dark trousers and a top hat<span class="wrap">)</span></span> or, in the US, a <span class="eb">tuxedo</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a black suit with a white shirt<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Women guests dress smartly and often wear hats. Men often hire their clothes for a wedding but women often use a wedding as an opportunity to buy something new.</span><span class="p">The bride traditionally arrives at the church a few minutes late and enters with her father who will <span class="eb">give her away</span> to her husband. The bride and groom <span class="eb">exchange vows</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> promise to stay together and support each other<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. The groom places a <span class="eb">wedding ring</span> on the third finger of the bride's left hand, and sometimes the bride gives him a ring too. The couple are then declared <span class="eb">man and wife</span>. They <span class="eb">sign the register</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the official record of marriages<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and as they leave the church guests throw rice or <span class="eb">confetti</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> small pieces of coloured paper in lucky shapes, such as horseshoes and bells<span class="wrap">)</span></span> over them.</span><span class="p">The ‘<span class="eb">happy couple</span>’ and their guests then go to the <span class="eb">wedding reception</span> at the bride's home, a hotel or the place where the ceremony took place if it was not a church or registry office. There are often speeches by the best man, the bride's father and the bridegroom. The bride and groom together cut a <span class="eb">wedding cake</span>, which usually has several tiers <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> layers<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, each covered with white icing (<span class="ei">AmE</span> frosting), with figures of a bride and groom on the top one. Before the <span class="eb">newly-weds</span> leave for their <span class="eb">honeymoon</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a holiday to celebrate their marriage<span class="wrap">)</span></span> the bride throws her bouquet in the air: there is a belief that the woman who catches it will soon be married herself. The car the couple leave in has usually been decorated by their friends with the words ‘<span class="eb">just married</span>’ and with old tin cans or shoes tied to the back.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Old English</span></span> <span class="etym_i">weddung</span> (see <span class="xr"><span class="xh">wed</span></span>, <span class="xr"><span class="xh">-ing</span></span>).</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I met her at my brother’s wedding.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I work in the wedding industry.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She had a plain wedding band on her third finger.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The minister was asked to officiate at the wedding.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The royal wedding will take place in June.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The wedding went off without a hitch.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The wedding will be conducted by the local priest.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">They had a small wedding with close friends and family.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We haven’t set a wedding date yet.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We were choosing what present to buy from the wedding list they’d sent.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a ring on her wedding finger</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">All her friends could hear wedding bells.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The wedding took place two years ago.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Today is our wedding anniversary.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a wedding dress/​present/​cake/​reception/​anniversary</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
