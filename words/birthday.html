On their birthday, people receive <span class="eb">birthday cards</span> and <span class="eb">birthday presents</span> from their family and friends. Children's cards often have a large number on them showing how old they are. Cards for adults have pictures of flowers or scenery, or humorous or rude cartoons. Cards for <span class="eb">significant</span> birthdays, such as 18, 40 or 60 may also have a large number on them. Inside the cards, there is usually a simple greeting, such as ‘Happy Birthday’ or ‘Many Happy Returns of the Day’. Children expect to receive a special birthday present from their parents.</span><span class="p">In the US, children who have their birthdays during the school year take a cake to school and have a small party with their class. In Britain children sometimes get <span class="eb">bumped</span> by their friends <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> lifted off the ground horizontally and put down again sharply<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, the same number of times as their age.</span><span class="p">Many younger children invite their friends to a <span class="eb">birthday party</span> at their home. <span class="ndv">Balloons</span> are often tied to the gate of the house where the party is being held. Children wear their <span class="eb">party clothes</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> best clothes<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and take a present. They play <span class="eb">party games</span> such as ‘pin the tail on the donkey’ or ‘musical chairs’. Sometimes parents arrange for an entertainer such as a <span class="ndv">magician</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a person who does magic tricks<span class="wrap">)</span></span> to visit the house, or they organize a celebration at a restaurant, <span class="ndv">leisure centre</span>, etc. After the games there is a special tea with a <span class="eb">birthday cake</span>. The cake is covered with sugar <span class="ndv">icing</span> (<span class="ei">AmE</span> <span class="ndv">frosting</span>), and has small candles on top, the same number of candles as the child's age. As the cake is carried into the room with the candles lit, everyone sings ‘<span class="ebi">Happy Birthday To You!</span>’ and then the <span class="eb">birthday boy</span> or <span class="eb">birthday girl</span> tries to blow out all the candles with one breath and makes a secret wish.</span><span class="p">In the US the 16th birthday is called <span class="eb">sweet sixteen</span>. In many states it is the age at which a person can get a US driver's licence, and some wealthier parents give their children a car as a present. At 18, in Britain and in the US, young people become adults and many have a big party. In most parts of the US 21 is the age at which people can drink alcohol legally. In Britain people celebrate 21st birthdays less than when 21 was the age at which they became adults.</span><span class="p">Many adults dislike getting older and a few lie about their age, saying they are younger than they really are. But in general older people are now much more willing to tell others their age. You may see a sign by the side of a road saying, for example: ‘Dave Ellis 40 today!’, put there by Dave's friends. At about 65 people <span class="ndv">retire</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> stop working<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, and those who have reached this age are called ‘senior citizens’. Few people live to be 100, so a 100th birthday is very special. In Britain people reaching this age may receive a card containing a printed message from the Queen.</span></span></span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He had a portrait painted as a birthday surprise for his daughter.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He is approaching his 40th birthday, and thinking of retiring from sport.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Here comes the birthday girl!</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I hope you have a nice birthday.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I reached my 86th birthday this year.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I’ll be 28 next birthday.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She spent her 50th birthday in Paris.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She’ll be 34 on her next birthday.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">They share the same birthday.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We’re taking him to see the new film for his birthday treat.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">What do you want for your birthday?</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Wish John a happy birthday from me.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">an exhibition to mark the artist’s 70th birthday</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He was approaching his sixtieth birthday.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">It’s Sam’s birthday tomorrow.
