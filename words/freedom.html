The Constitution was written in the late 1700s to explain not only how the US government would work , but also what limits there would be on its power. At that time, people were beginning to believe that the rights of individuals were important, and that the government was the main threat to those rights. Limiting the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">federal governments'</span></span> power was also seen as necessary to protect the rights of states within the United States.</span><span class="p">Britain does not have a written constitution or legal document describing the rights of individuals but for British people freedom to live without interference from government is important. Proposals to introduce <span class="eb">identity cards</span> for everyone are always resisted and people often talk about the <span class="eb">nanny state</span> when they feel the government is interfering in their lives.</span><span class="p">In Britain and the US the most basic rights include <span class="eb">freedom of expression</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> freedom to say or write what you think<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, <span class="eb">freedom of choice</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> freedom to make decisions about your own life<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="eb">freedom of worship</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> freedom to practise any religion<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">Freedom of expression does not imply complete freedom for people to say what they like. In the US the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">First Amendment</span> protects freedom of speech and of the press but the courts, especially the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Supreme Court</span>, decide how it should be applied. For instance, a newspaper is not allowed to print something bad about a person that is known not to be true: this is <span class="eb">libel</span>. The courts do not practise <span class="eb">prior restraint</span>, i.e. they cannot stop a newspaper from printing something, but they can punish the newspaper afterwards. However, in a few cases, e.g. when national security is involved, the courts may order newspapers not to print a report.</span><span class="p">The right to free speech in the US has not always been respected. In the 1950s, when was at its height, people who were suspected of being Communists were called before <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Congress</span> to answer questions. People who used their right to free speech and said they believed in Communism, or who <span class="eb">took the Fifth</span>, i.e. used their right under the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Fifth Amendment</span></span> not to give evidence against themselves, often lost their jobs or went to prison.</span><span class="p">In Britain until 1968 all plays had to be approved by the Lord Chamberlain before they could be performed in theatres. <span class="eb">Censorship</span> of the press ended in the 1960s. Newspapers are expected to behave responsibly and members of the public have the right to complain about what is published in the press to the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Press Complaints Commission</span></span>. Recently there have been complaints about newspapers secretly listening to and reading people's phone messages. This practice is known as <span class="eb">phone hacking</span> and in 2011 a <span class="ndv">commission</span> was set up under a senior judge, Lord Justice Leveson, to investigate this and other aspects of the British press. The commission proposed that an independent organization should replace the Press Complaints Commission.</span><span class="p">The <span class="eb">right of equal opportunity</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the right to be treated the same as others, regardless of race, sex, etc.<span class="wrap">)</span></span> is enforced in Britain through the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Race Relations Acts</span></span> and the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Sex Discrimination Act</span></span>. In the US the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">civil rights movement</span> of the 1960s influenced the making of new laws to protect the rights of minority groups, especially <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">African Americans</span>. In 1972 an <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Equal Rights Amendment</span></span>, which would have given women the same rights and opportunities as men, failed to get the support of enough states to be passed. Later, however, several laws were passed making it illegal to discriminate against women. In Britain the <span class="eb">Human Rights Act</span> was passed in 1998, which stated that public organizations had to follow the principles listed in the <span class="eb">European Convention on Human Rights</span>.</span><span class="p">People in Britain and the US have a much valued <span class="eb">right to privacy</span>. The US and British <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Freedom of Information Acts</span></span> and the British <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Data Protection Act</span></span> allow a person access to information held about them and the opportunity to correct it if it is wrong.</span><span class="p">In the US several amendments to the Constitution deal specifically with the rights of people suspected or accused of a crime. In Britain recent changes to <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">habeas corpus</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> the right of a person detained by the police to be released within 24 hours if not charged<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="eb">the right to remain silent</span> when arrested, which were introduced as part of the laws against <span class="ndv">terrorism</span>, met with strong opposition from many people. It is now possible for the police to keep a person for 28 days before they are charged. In both Britain and the US the police are heavily criticized if people's rights are <span class="eb">infringed</span>.</span><span class="p">In the US an individual's right to own weapons continues to cause disagreement. When this right was included in the Second Amendment, America had just finished fighting for independence. Since the US did not want to keep a permanent army, its defence in the case of future attacks depended on ordinary people having weapons. Many people believe that, since the US now has a professional army, individuals do not need guns, and that the interpretation of the amendment should take account of the modern situation. But others want to keep the right to have weapons and resist any changes to the law. This view is put forward especially by <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">the National Rifle Association</span></span>.</span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a
