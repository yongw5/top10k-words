because of the long distances between cities. The distance between <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Boston</span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">San Francisco</span></span>, for instance, is more than 3 000 miles/ 4 827 kilometres. The US began to build the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">interstate</span> highway <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> fast, long-distance road<span class="wrap">)</span></span> system in 1956. By 2004 it had more than 42 000 miles/67 578 kilometres of road. The interstate system greatly helped the country's economy, but it also hurt the economies of many small towns not on an interstate. Interstates running north to south have odd numbers and those going from east to west have even numbers. They often have only two or three <span class="eb">lanes</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> marked sections for lines of traffic<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in each direction through the <span class="ndv">countryside</span> but may have eight or more each way through cities. The New Jersey Turnpike, for instance, has 14 lanes each way near New York City.</span><span class="p">Other major roads in the US are called <span class="eb">superhighways</span>, <span class="eb">freeways</span>, <span class="eb">expressways</span>, <span class="eb">thruways</span> or <span class="eb">parkways</span>. There are also many county and local roads, called variously <span class="eb">arterial roads</span>, <span class="eb">feeder roads</span> or <span class="eb">farm roads</span>. Some states have <span class="eb">tollways</span> or <span class="eb">turnpikes</span>, on which drivers must pay a <span class="ndv">toll</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> sum of money<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">Interstate <span class="ndv">highways</span> are marked with red and blue signs showing an ‘I’ followed by the road's number. Other US highways have red, white and blue signs. Some state roads, like those in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Louisiana</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Texas</span>, have signs in the shape of the state. Since 1995 states have been able to set their own speed limits. This is usually 65 or 70 mph/105 or 112 kph on interstate roads but lower on other main roads.</span><span class="p">In Britain the fastest and most direct routes between major cities are by motorways, which usually have three lanes of traffic in each direction and a speed limit of 70 mph/112 kph. Each motorway is identified by the letter ‘M’ and a number. Main roads other than motorways are called <span class="eb">A-roads</span> and are numbered A6, A34, etc. Some A-roads are <span class="eb">dual carriageways</span> with two or more lanes each way. Most A-roads now follow a <span class="eb">bypass</span> round towns. Narrower roads which have only one lane in each direction are called <span class="eb">B-roads</span>. Most roads have <span class="eb">white lines</span> and <span class="eb">Catseyes</span>™ <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> objects sunk into the ground that reflect a car's lights<span class="wrap">)</span></span> down the middle. Only a very few roads have <span class="ndv">tolls</span> but Britain's first toll motorway, the M6 Toll, opened in 2003 as an alternative to the heavily used M6 near Birmingham. Narrow country roads below B-road standard (called <span class="eb">unclassified roads</span>) may be known locally by the name of the place they go to, e.g. Orston Lane. Some country roads may be <span class="eb">single track</span> and only wide enough for one vehicle. In this case, there are frequent <span class="eb">passing places</span>, where a vehicle can wait to let another through.</span><span class="p">In Britain the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Highway Code</span> describes the many signs placed beside roads. Red circular signs give instructions that must by law be obeyed. These include ‘no overtaking’ signs and signs about speed limits. Red <span class="ndv">triangular</span> signs give warnings about possible dangers ahead, e.g. slippery roads. Direction signs to major towns are blue on motorways and green on other roads; signs to smaller places are white. Old-fashioned <span class="eb">signposts</span> can still be seen in some country areas.</span><span class="p">In the US red road signs, like ‘Stop’, must be obeyed. Signs that indicate danger, as in areas where rocks might fall, have a yellow diamond shape. Arrows indicating bends in the road are shown in green circles on white signs. Many other US road signs are now similar to those in Europe.</span><span class="p">In Britain there is pressure from both business and private road users for more and better roads, despite the damage to the environment and increase in pollution that this may cause. People who are against the building of new roads regularly challenge proposed routes of new motorways or bypasses. If they fail, <span class="ndv">environmentalists</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> people who care specially about the environment<span class="wrap">)</span></span> may set up protest camps along the route of the new road. Recently, experts too have cast doubt on the wisdom of building more roads, saying it simply encourages greater use of cars. In the US there are few protests against road-building. People generally want more roads to make their journeys faster and more convenient.</span></span></span></span> </li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a href="entry://#86a05b2ba9f04005b922940741c9a96d" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2 </span><span class="sym_first"> <a class="oxford3000 no-href">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="v-gs" type="alt"><span class="v-g"><span class="v"><strong>Road</strong></span></span></span> <span class="v-gs" type="ab"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">abbreviation</span> <span class="v-g"><span class="v"><strong>Rd</strong></span></span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">used in names of roads, especially in towns</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">35 York Road</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="More About"><span class="unbox"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">More About</span><span class="body"><span class="h1">roads</span><span class="h2">Roads and streets</span><span class="bullet"><span class="li"> In a town or city, <span class="eb">street</span> is the most general word for a road with houses and buildings on one or both sides:<span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"><span class="x">a street map of London.</span></span></span> <span class="eb">Street</span> is not used for roads between towns, but streets in towns are often called <span class="eb">Road</span>:<span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"><span class="x">Oxford Street</span></span> <span class="x-g"><span class="rx-g"><span class="x">Mile End Road.</span></span></span></span> A <span class="eb">road map</span> of a country shows you the major routes between, around and through towns and cities.</span><span class="li"> Other words used in the names of streets include: <span class="eb">Circle</span>, <span class="eb">Court</span>, <span class="eb">Crescent</span>, <span class="eb">Drive</span>, <span class="eb">Hill</span> and <span class="eb">Way</span>. <span class="eb">Avenue</span> suggests a wide street lined with trees.

An <span class="ndv">exception</span> is the A1 from London to north-eastern England, which is often called the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Great North Road</span></span>. Roads that follow the line of former <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Roman roads</span> also have names, e.g. the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Fosse Way</span></span>. If a main road passes through a town, that part of it usually has a name, often that of the place which the road goes to, e.g. London Road.</span><span class="p">The main shopping street in a town is often called High Street, or sometimes Market Street. Many streets take their name from a local feature or building. The most common include Bridge Street, Castle Street, Church Street, Mill Street and Station Road. Some names indicate the trade that was formerly carried on in that area. Examples are Candlemaker's Row, Cornmarket, Petticoat Lane and Sheep Street. Many streets laid out in the 19th century were named after famous people or events. These include Albert Street, Cromwell Road, Shakespeare Street, Wellington Street, Trafalgar Road and Waterloo Street. When <span class="ndv">housing estates</span> are built, the names of the new roads in them are usually all on the same theme. Names of birds or animals are popular. Others are based on the old names for the fields that the houses were built on, e.g. Tenacres Road, The Slade and Meadow Walk. The name of a road is written on signs at each end of it, sometimes together with the local <span class="ndv">postcode</span>.</span><span class="p">Some streets have become so closely identified with people of a particular profession that the street name itself is immediately associated with them. In London, <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Harley Street</span> has been associated with private doctors and <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Fleet Street</span> with newspapers.</span><span class="p">In the US main roads such as <span class="ndv">interstates</span> and <span class="ndv">highways</span> are known by numbers. Most towns and cities are laid out on a <span class="eb">grid</span> pattern and have long <span class="eb">streets</span> with <span class="eb">avenues</span> crossing them. Each has a number, e.g. 7th Avenue, 42nd Street. The roads are often straight and have square <span class="eb">blocks</span> of buildings between them. This makes it easier to find an address and also helps people to judge distance. In <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Manhattan</span>, for example, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Tiffany's</span> is described as being at East 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, i.e. on the corner of those two streets. The distance between West 90th Street and West 60th Street is 30 blocks.</span><span class="p">As well as having numbers, many streets are named after people, places, local features, history and nature. In Manhattan there is Washington Street, Lexington Avenue, Liberty Street, Church Street and Cedar Street. Some streets are named after the town to which they lead. The most important street is often called <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Main Street</span>. A <span class="eb">suburb</span> or <span class="eb">subdivision</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> group of houses built together in a section of a city<span class="wrap">)</span></span> of a city may have streets with similar names. In a subdivision of Baton Rouge, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Louisiana</span>, all the names end in ‚wood‘, e.g. Balsawood Drive, Limewood Drive and Aspenwood Drive.</span><span class="p">Some roads are called boulevards, with <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Hollywood's</span> <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Sunset Boulevard</span></span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Miami's</span> Biscayne Boulevard among the best known. Avenues usually cross streets, as in New York, but often the word is chosen as part of a name for no particular reason. <span class="ei">Avenue</span> and <span class="ei">boulevard</span> once indicated roads with trees along each side, but few have trees today. A <span class="ei">road</span> in the US is usually found outside cities, though Chicago uses the name for some central streets.</span><span class="p">Some street names have particular associations: Grant Avenue in <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">San Francisco</span></span> is associated with <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Chinatown</span>, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Beale Street</span></span> in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Memphis</span> with the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">blues</span>, and Bourbon Street in New Orleans with <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">jazz</span>. In New York <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Wall Street</span> is associated with the financial world, <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Madison Avenue</span> with <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">advertising</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Broadway</span> with theatres.</span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a
