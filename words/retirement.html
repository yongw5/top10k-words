if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Culture</span><span class="body"><span class="h1">retirement</span><span class="p">In Britain most people retire <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> give up work because they are old<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in their <span class="ndv">sixties</span>. The majority of men retire at 65. The <span class="eb">retirement age</span> for women used to be 60, but this has been raised recently, and many women retire later. Some people <span class="eb">take early retirement</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> choose to retire early<span class="wrap">)</span></span> from about 50.</span><span class="p">In the US the usual retirement age is also 65. People can choose to retire earlier but may get less money from their <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">pension</span>. In the US, the phrase <span class="ei">early retirement</span> suggests that retirement has been proposed by a person's employer as an alternative to them being made <span class="ndv">redundant</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> unemployed<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Companies do this sometimes when they need to reduce the number of people working for them. Since older people are usually paid more than younger ones, the company may ask them to retire and hire younger people to replace them. A few people choose to continue working after the age of 65, though some employers require employees to retire between 65 and 70.</span><span class="p">When somebody retired after many years with the same employer they used to be given a present by the company. Traditionally this was a gold watch or a clock. Now, few people work for the same company for all their working lives and do not receive a present from their employer. Instead, their colleagues contribute money for a present and organize a party.</span><span class="p">A person's quality of life in retirement depends largely on the amount of money they have. Many receive pensions, some have savings in the bank. In Britain people have at least a basic pension from the state. In the US most people can receive <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">social security</span> benefits, and can get government help in paying for their medical care. Many retired people have to live on a <span class="eb">fixed income</span> and find retirement hard.</span><span class="p">Now that older people have better health and live longer, people over retirement age are becoming an increasingly important economic and social force. The number of retired people in Britain and the US is growing, and through organizations like the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">American Association of Retired Persons</span></span> and, in Britain, the <span class="eb">National Pensioners Convention</span>, they have increased power to demand the services they need and the rights they deserve. This is sometimes referred to as ‘grey power’.</span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g" ox3000="y"><a href="entry://#7347479faba4402c9b4448c2e4161344" class="sen"></a><span class="num">3 </span><span class="sym_first"> <a class="oxford3000 no-href">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">uncountable</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="cf"><span class="exp">retirement</span> (from something)</span> <span class="def">the act of stopping a particular type of work, especially in sport, politics, etc.</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">He announced his retirement from football.</span></span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">She <span class="cl"><strong>came out of retirement</strong></span> to win two gold medals at the championships.</span></span></span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">After her retirement from the stage she began to drink.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He has a good retirement income.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He is going to come out of retirement for this one last concert.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He provided for a comfortable retirement by selling the business.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He remained in the post until his retirement last year.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Her official retirement date is March 12.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">His father was now living in retirement in France.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I intend to spend my retirement playing golf.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I’ve been thinking about where I might like to spend my retirement years.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">In 1996 health problems forced her retirement.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">It was their final concert before entering retirement.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She announced her impending retirement.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She has found a new hobby in her retirement.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She took voluntary retirement in 2001.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">She’s saving for her retirement.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Thanks to his diligence, his retirement portfolio is flourishing.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The age of retirement for all employees is 60.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The company suggested that he should take early retirement.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The website helps you plan your retirement.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">They have about $14 800 in retirement savings.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">They presented him with a watch to mark his retirement.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Your pension plan provides a cash lump sum at retirement.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a gift from the company on his retirement</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">compulsory retirement at 60</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">helping you to plan your retirement</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">her enforced retirement from the sport</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">her retirement as sales director</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">his official retirement in 2012</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">his retirement from first-class cricket</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">important matters like health care and retirement security</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">investments to fund their retirement</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">older adults who relocate to retirement communities</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">retirement at age fifty</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the benefits of private retirement accounts</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">to take early retirement</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
