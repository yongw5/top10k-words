It is played by boys in most schools. Most towns have an <span class="ndv">amateur</span> football team <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a team which does not get paid for playing<span class="wrap">)</span></span> which plays in a <span class="eb">minor league</span>. Football is also the most popular <span class="eb">spectator sport</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> sport that is watched<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in Britain. Many people go to see their favourite professional team playing <span class="eb">at home</span>, and some go to <span class="eb">away matches</span>. Many more people watch football on television.</span><span class="p">The rules of football are relatively simple: two teams of 11 players try to get a round ball into the opposing team's <span class="eb">goal</span> and to prevent their opponents from scoring. The ball may be kicked or <span class="eb">headed</span>, but never <span class="ndv">handled</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> touched with the hand<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, except by the <span class="eb">goalkeepers</span>. The <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Football Association</span></span> was founded in 1863 to decide the rules of football and the resulting game became known formally as <span class="eb">association football</span>. It is sometimes also called <span class="eb">soccer</span>. Many of today's leading <span class="eb">clubs</span> were established shortly afterwards.</span><span class="p">Most professional clubs represent large cities, or parts of London. They include <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Everton</span>, Liverpool, <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Manchester United</span></span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Arsenal</span>, <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Chelsea</span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Tottenham Hotspur</span></span>. The most famous Scottish clubs include <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Rangers</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Celtic</span>. In 1992 football was reorganized so that the best 20 teams in England and Wales play in the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Premier League</span></span>, while 70 other teams play in three <span class="eb">divisions</span>, run by the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Football League</span></span>. There is a <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Scottish Professional Football League</span></span> with four divisions, formed in 2013 when the Scottish Football League joined with the Scottish Premier League. At the end of each season, the top few teams in each division are <span class="eb">promoted</span> and the bottom teams are <span class="eb">relegated</span>. As well as the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Premier League</span></span>, the main competitions in England and Wales are the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">FA Cup</span></span> and the <span class="eb">League Cup</span>. A few of the most successful sides have won <span class="eb">the Double</span>, the Premier League and the FA cup in the same year. The biggest clubs are now run as major businesses, and top players earn large salaries. They are frequently <span class="eb">transferred</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> bought and sold<span class="wrap">)</span></span> between clubs for millions of pounds. Many foreign stars also now play for British teams, and in many top clubs British players are in the minority.</span><span class="p">England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all have their own national sides. England won the World Cup in 1966, when its stars included Bobby Charlton, Bobby Moore and Geoff Hurst.</span><span class="p">An increase in <span class="eb">football hooliganism</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> violence and damage to property by supporters<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in the 1970s and 1980s frightened many people away from football matches. English fans got a bad reputation in Europe and football violence became known as ‘the English disease’. Disasters such as that at <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Hillsborough</span>, in which many people died, also discouraged people from going to matches. Formerly, football grounds had <span class="eb">terraces</span>, where supporters stood packed close together, and <span class="eb">stands</span> containing rows of seats which were more expensive. These grounds have now almost all been replaced by <span class="eb">all-seater stadiums</span>, but people complain about the rising cost of tickets. Many clubs have their own <span class="eb">fanzine</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a magazine about the club written and published by the fans<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. Some supporters also buy a copy of their team's <span class="eb">strip</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> shorts and shirt in team colours<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">This type of football is known in the US as soccer to distinguish it from the American game. Enthusiasm increased after 1994 when the World Cup was played for the first time in the US. In 1999 the US won the Women's World Cup. In 1996 <span class="eb">Major League Soccer</span> (<span class="eb">MLS</span>) was established, and teams compete for the <span class="eb">MLS Cup</span>. Students in colleges and universities also play soccer in three <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">NCAA</span> divisions. The nation's oldest <span class="ndv">tournament</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> series of games that leads to one winner<span class="wrap">)</span></span> is the US Open Cup. Many millions of American children now play regularly, and the expression <span class="ei">soccer mom</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> a mother who spends a lot of time taking her children to sporting activities<span class="wrap">)</span></span> has entered the language.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def">late 19th cent.</span>: shortening of <span class="xr"><span class="xh">Assoc.</span></span> + <span class="xr"><span class="xh">-er</span></span>.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He played on the Irish junior soccer team.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">He was wearing a yellow Brazil soccer jersey.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The kids are at soccer practice.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">a pair of soccer cleats</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
