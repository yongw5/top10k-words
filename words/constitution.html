It is also a <span class="eb">parliamentary democracy</span>, a country whose government is controlled by a parliament that has been elected by the people. The highest positions in government are taken by elected <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Members of Parliament</span>, also called MPs. The king or queen now has little real power.</span><span class="p">The principles and procedures by which Britain is governed have developed over many centuries. They are not written down in a single document that can be referred to in a dispute. The British Constitution is made up of <span class="eb">statute law</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> laws agreed by Parliament<span class="wrap">)</span></span>, <span class="eb">common law</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> judges' decisions made in court and then written down<span class="wrap">)</span></span> and <span class="eb">conventions</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> rules and practices that people cannot be forced to obey but which are considered necessary for efficient government<span class="wrap">)</span></span>. The Constitution can be altered by <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">Acts of Parliament</span></span>, or by general agreement.</span><span class="p">Similarly, there is no single document that lists people's rights. Some rights have been formally recognized by Parliament through laws, e.g. the right of a person not to be <span class="ndv">discriminated</span> against <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> treated differently<span class="wrap">)</span></span> because of his or her sex. The Human Rights Act 1998 made all the rights established in the European Convention on Human Rights part of British law. It is generally understood that these rights are part of the Constitution.</span><span class="p">A government department, the Department for Constitutional Affairs, was set up in 2003 with responsibility for the areas of government where there are constitutional changes, for example the reforms in the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">House of Lords</span> and relations with the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Scottish Parliament</span> and the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Welsh Assembly</span>. In 2007 the duties of this department were taken over by the Ministry of Justice.</span></span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Culture"><span class="unbox"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Culture</span> <span class="def">The US Constitution was created after the <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">American Revolution</span></span> when leaders from each state held a meeting called the <span class="ndv">Constitutional Convention</span> to agree on a document describing the new system of government and limiting its powers, which was signed in 1789. This established the <span class="ndv">three branches of government</span>: the <span class="ndv">legislative</span> branch which consists of <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Congress</span>, the <span class="ndv">judicial</span> branch which is the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Supreme Court</span> and lower courts created by Congress and the <span class="ndv">executive</span> branch which consists of the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">president</span>, vice-president and government departments. The Constitution contains details about the responsibilities of each branch and who can be elected to Congress. It says that the US government is responsible for protecting individual states. Since 1789 there have been 27 <span class="ndv">amendments</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> changes<span class="wrap">)</span></span> to the Constitution including the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Bill of Rights</span> (1791) which promised citizens a number of rights such as the right to free speech and freedom of religion. There is sometimes disagreement about how to <span class="ndv">interpret</span> the Constitution, some people believing that it is better to follow exactly what the Constitution says and others that it is necessary to consider what the intention of each part was and how that relates to the situation today. The Supreme Court can decide that a law is <span class="ndv">unconstitutional</span> so that it cannot be used any more.</span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#6a3b851ac3124281a6e2cc23b8d6eab0" class="sen"></a><span class="num">2</span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">countable</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="def">the condition of a person’s body and how healthy it is</span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">to have a <span class="cl"><strong>healthy/strong/weak constitution</strong></span></span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#6a3b851ac3124281a6e2cc23b8d6eab0" class="sen"></a><span class="num">3</span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">uncountable</span><span class="sep">,</span> <span class="gram">countable</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="label-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="reg">formal</span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">the way something is formed or organized </span><span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">synonym</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://structure" otitle="structure definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">structure</span></span></a></span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">the genetic constitution of cells</span></span></span></li><li class="sn-g"><a href="entry://#6a3b851ac3124281a6e2cc23b8d6eab0" class="sen"></a><span class="num">4</span><span class="gram-g"><span class="wrap">[</span><span class="gram">uncountable</span><span class="wrap">]</span></span> <span class="label-g"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="reg">formal</span><span class="wrap">)</span></span> <span class="def">the act of forming something</span> <span class="xr-gs"><span class="prefix">synonym</span> <a class="Ref" href="entry://establishment" otitle="establishment definition"><span class="xr-g"><span class="xh">establishment</span></span></a></span><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="rx-g"><span class="x">He recommended the constitution of a review committee.</span></span></span></span></li></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Word Origin"><span class="unbox is-active"> <span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Word Origin</span><span class="body"> <span class="def"><span class="lang">Middle English</span></span> (denoting a law, or a body of laws or customs): from <span class="lang">Latin</span> <span class="ff">constitutio(n-)</span>, from <span class="ff">constituere</span> ‘establish, appoint’, from <span class="ff">con-</span> ‘together’ + <span class="ff">statuere</span> ‘set up’.</span></span></span><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Britain does not have a written constitution.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Parliament will vote to amend the constitution.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The child had a weak constitution and was always ill.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The constitution stipulated that a general election must be held within 120 days.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The constitution was suspended and the army was placed in full control.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The new constitution will be adopted next year.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The president felt free to interpret the constitution as he saw fit.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">The president’s actions violate the constitution.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">These principles are enshrined in the country’s constitution.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">These rights are established in the federal constitution.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Under the constitution, an election must be called every five years.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">plans to draft a new constitution</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">A two-thirds majority is needed to amend the club’s constitution.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">I have a strong constitution and my stomach can handle anything.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </ol> </div></div>
