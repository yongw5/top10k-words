The distance between <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Boston</span> and <span class="xr-g"><span class="ndv">San Francisco</span></span>, for instance, is more than 3 000 miles/ 4 827 kilometres. The US began to build the <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">interstate</span> highway <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> fast, long-distance road<span class="wrap">)</span></span> system in 1956. By 2004 it had more than 42 000 miles/67 578 kilometres of road. The interstate system greatly helped the country's economy, but it also hurt the economies of many small towns not on an interstate. Interstates running north to south have odd numbers and those going from east to west have even numbers. They often have only two or three <span class="eb">lanes</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> marked sections for lines of traffic<span class="wrap">)</span></span> in each direction through the <span class="ndv">countryside</span> but may have eight or more each way through cities. The New Jersey Turnpike, for instance, has 14 lanes each way near New York City.</span><span class="p">Other major roads in the US are called <span class="eb">superhighways</span>, <span class="eb">freeways</span>, <span class="eb">expressways</span>, <span class="eb">thruways</span> or <span class="eb">parkways</span>. There are also many county and local roads, called variously <span class="eb">arterial roads</span>, <span class="eb">feeder roads</span> or <span class="eb">farm roads</span>. Some states have <span class="eb">tollways</span> or <span class="eb">turnpikes</span>, on which drivers must pay a <span class="ndv">toll</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> sum of money<span class="wrap">)</span></span>.</span><span class="p">Interstate <span class="ndv">highways</span> are marked with red and blue signs showing an ‘I’ followed by the road's number. Other US highways have red, white and blue signs. Some state roads, like those in <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Louisiana</span> and <span class="ndv" type="singlewd">Texas</span>, have signs in the shape of the state. Since 1995 states have been able to set their own speed limits. This is usually 65 or 70 mph/105 or 112 kph on interstate roads but lower on other main roads.</span><span class="p">In Britain the fastest and most direct routes between major cities are by motorways, which usually have three lanes of traffic in each direction and a speed limit of 70 mph/112 kph. Each motorway is identified by the letter ‘M’ and a number. Main roads other than motorways are called <span class="eb">A-roads</span> and are numbered A6, A34, etc. Some A-roads are <span class="eb">dual carriageways</span> with two or more lanes each way. Most A-roads now follow a <span class="eb">bypass</span> round towns. Narrower roads which have only one lane in each direction are called <span class="eb">B-roads</span>. Most roads have <span class="eb">white lines</span> and <span class="eb">Catseyes</span>™ <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> objects sunk into the ground that reflect a car's lights<span class="wrap">)</span></span> down the middle. Only a very few roads have <span class="ndv">tolls</span> but Britain's first toll motorway, the M6 Toll, opened in 2003 as an alternative to the heavily used M6 near Birmingham. Narrow country roads below B-road standard (called <span class="eb">unclassified roads</span>) may be known locally by the name of the place they go to, e.g. Orston Lane. Some country roads may be <span class="eb">single track</span> and only wide enough for one vehicle. In this case, there are frequent <span class="eb">passing places</span>, where a vehicle can wait to let another through.</span><span class="p">In Britain the <span class="ndv" type="deadxref">Highway Code</span> describes the many signs placed beside roads. Red circular signs give instructions that must by law be obeyed. These include ‘no overtaking’ signs and signs about speed limits. Red <span class="ndv">triangular</span> signs give warnings about possible dangers ahead, e.g. slippery roads. Direction signs to major towns are blue on motorways and green on other roads; signs to smaller places are white. Old-fashioned <span class="eb">signposts</span> can still be seen in some country areas.</span><span class="p">In the US red road signs, like ‘Stop’, must be obeyed. Signs that indicate danger, as in areas where rocks might fall, have a yellow diamond shape. Arrows indicating bends in the road are shown in green circles on white signs. Many other US road signs are now similar to those in Europe.</span><span class="p">In Britain there is pressure from both business and private road users for more and better roads, despite the damage to the environment and increase in pollution that this may cause. People who are against the building of new roads regularly challenge proposed routes of new motorways or bypasses. If they fail, <span class="ndv">environmentalists</span> <span class="gl"><span class="wrap">(</span><span class="prefix">=</span> people who care specially about the environment<span class="wrap">)</span></span> may set up protest camps along the route of the new road. Recently, experts too have cast doubt on the wisdom of building more roads, saying it simply encourages greater use of cars. In the US there are few protests against road-building. People generally want more roads to make their journeys faster and more convenient.</span></span></span></span> </span></span> <span class="res-g"><span class="collapse" otitle="Extra examples"><span class="unbox"><span class="heading" onclick="if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox'){this.parentNode.className='unbox is-active';}else if(this.parentNode.className=='unbox is-active'){this.parentNode.className='unbox';}">Extra examples</span><span class="body"><span class="x-gs"><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">We were driving down the interstate.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">You can take Interstate 10 all the way into Baton Rouge.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">an eleven-car pile-up on the interstate</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">A motorist driving along the interstate saw the plane burst into flames.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">Speed limits are higher on some rural stretches of interstate highways.</span></span><span class="x-g"> <span class="x">There has been an increase in traffic deaths on rural interstates.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </div> </div></div>
